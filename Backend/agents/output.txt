"title : Anthropology and the cognitive challenge - author : Maurice Blochcategory : anthropologydescription : ""In this provocative new study one of the world's most distinguished anthropologists proposes that an understanding of cognitive science enriches, rather than threatens, the work of social scientists. Maurice Bloch argues for a naturalist approach to social and cultural anthropology, introducing developments in cognitive sciences such as psychology and neurology and exploring the relevance of these developments for central anthropological concerns: the person or the self, cosmology, kinship, memory and globalisation. Opening with an exploration of the history of anthropology, Bloch shows why and how naturalist approaches were abandoned and argues that these once valid reasons are no longer relevant. Bloch then shows how such subjects as the self, memory and the conceptualisation of time benefit from being simultaneously approached with the tools of social and cognitive science. Anthropology and the Cognitive Challenge will stimulate fresh debate among scholars and students across a wide range of disciplines""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Living Islam - author : Magnus Marsdencategory : anthropologydescription : Popular representations of Pakistan's North West Frontier have long featured simplistic images of tribal blood feuds, fanatical religion, and the seclusion of women. The rise to power of the radical Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan enhanced the region's reputation as a place of anti-Western militancy. Magnus Marsden is an anthropologist who has immersed himself in the lives of the Frontier's villagers for more than ten years. His evocative study of the Chitral region challenges all these stereotypes. Through an exploration of the everyday experiences of both men and women, he shows that the life of a good Muslim in Chitral is above all a mindful life, enhanced by the creative force of poetry, dancing and critical debate. Challenging much that has been assumed about the Muslim world, this study makes a powerful contribution to the understanding of religion and politics both within and beyond the Muslim societies of southern Asia.

"title : The spiritual brain - author : Mario Beauregardcategory : anthropologydescription : Do religious experiences come from God, or are they merely the random firing of neurons in the brain? Drawing on his own research with Carmelite nuns, neuroscientist Mario Beauregard shows that genuine, life-changing spiritual events can be documented. He offers compelling evidence that religious experiences have a nonmaterial origin, making a convincing case for what many in scientific fields are loath to consider—that it is God who creates our spiritual experiences, not the brain. Beauregard and O'Leary explore recent attempts to locate a ""God gene"" in some of us and claims that our brains are ""hardwired"" for religion—even the strange case of one neuroscientist who allegedly invented an electromagnetic ""God helmet"" that could produce a mystical experience in anyone who wore it. The authors argue that these attempts are misguided and narrow-minded, because they reduce spiritual experiences to material phenomena. Many scientists ignore hard evidence that challenges their materialistic prejudice, clinging to the limited view that our experiences are explainable only by material causes, in the obstinate conviction that the physical world is the only reality. But scientific materialism is at a loss to explain irrefutable accounts of mind over matter, of intuition, willpower, and leaps of faith, of the ""placebo effect"" in medicine, of near-death experiences on the operating table, and of psychic premonitions of a loved one in crisis, to say nothing of the occasional sense of oneness with nature and mystical experiences in meditation or prayer. Traditional science explains away these and other occurrences as delusions or misunderstandings, but by exploring the latest neurological research on phenomena such as these, The Spiritual Brain gets to their real source.

In this provocative, intelligent, and convincing endorsement of today's mass entertainment, national bestselling author Steven Johnson argues that the pop culture we soak in every day-from The Lord of the Rings to Grand Theft Auto to The Simpsons-has been growing more and more sophisticated and, far from rotting our brains, is actually posing new cognitive challenges that are making our minds measurably sharper.

Focusing on the systematisation and classification of illness in its multiple forms, manifestations and causes, this volume examines case studies ranging from popular concepts illness through to specialist discourses on it. Using philological, historical and anthropological approaches, the contributions cover perspectives across time from East Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cultures, spanning ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece and Rome to Tibet and China. They aim to capture the multiplicity of illness concepts and medical traditions within specific societies, and to investigate the historical dynamics of stability and change linked to such concepts.

Problems include remoteness and insularity, peripherality to centralized sites of decision-making, a limited range of natural resources, specialization of economics, small markets, a narrow skills base, poor infrastructure and environmental fragility. These issues are discussed in relation to the creation of music in the construction of an islander identity. Of particular interest is the way in which islanders discuss their music and how it articulates the idea of the 'other' diaspora.

"title : The politics of governance - author : Lucy Koechlincategory : anthropologydescription : ""How do government arrangements emerge? When and how does individual agency turn into collective agency? How do sensory experiences of violence, instability, etc affect the configuration of governance arrangements? When, why, and how are governance arrangements institutionalized?This book seeks to contribute to a non-normative conceptualization of the emergence and transformation of government arrangements, and addresses the under-theorization of actors and agency in conventional governance theories. The editors and contributors theorize the concept of governance more concretely by analyzing the key actors and arrangements that define states of governance across different places and by examining its performance and development in particular settings and time periods. Each contribution to the edited volume is based on a case-study drawn from Africa, though the book argues that the core issues identified remain the same across the world, though in different empirical contexts. The contributions also range across key disciplines, from anthropology to sociology to political science.This ground-breaking volume addresses governance arrangements, discusses how social actors form such arrangements, and concludes by synthesizing an actor-centered understanding of political articulation to a general theory of governance. Scholars across disciplines such as political science, development studies, African studies, and sociology will find the book insightful. ""--   Read more Read less"
"title : All Things New - author : Brock Bingamancategory : anthropologydescription : For both Maximus the Confessor (c. 580-662) and Jürgen Moltmann (B. 1926), understanding what it means to be human springs from a contemplative vision of God. This comparative study explores surprising parallels between the theological anthropology of the seventh-century Byzantine monk and the contemporary German Protestant. Bingaman argues that Maximus and Moltmann root their understanding of the human calling in their Trinitarian and christological reflection, in contrast to many modern theologies that tend to devise an account of human being first, and then try to find ways in which Christ and the Trinity are somehow relevant to this human being. In this constructive work, Bingaman demonstrates the intrinsic connection between Maximus and Moltmann's views of human being, Christ and the Trinity, the church, and the human calling in creation. Illustrating the richness of the ancient and postmodern theologies in conversation, All Things New lay out future trajectories in theological anthropology, patristic ressourcement, ecologically attuned theology and spirituality, and Orthodox-Protestant dialogue. --back.

"title : Artificial culture - author : Tama Leavercategory : anthropologydescription : ""Artificial Culture is an examination of the articulation, construction, and representation of ""the artificial"" in contemporary popular cultural texts, especially science fiction films and novels. The book argues that today we live in an artificial culture due to the deep and inextricable relationship between people, our bodies, and technology at large. While the artificial is often imagined as outside of the natural order and thus also beyond the realm of humanity, paradoxically, artificial concepts are simultaneously produced and constructed by human ideas and labor. The artificial can thus act as a boundary point against which we as a culture can measure what it means to be human. Science fiction feature films and novels, and other related media, frequently and provocatively deploy ideas of the artificial in ways which the lines between people, our bodies, spaces and culture more broadly blur and, at times, dissolve. Building on the rich foundational work on the figures of the cyborg and posthuman, this book situates the artificial in similar terms, but from a nevertheless distinctly different viewpoint. After examining ideas of the artificial as deployed in film, novels and other digital contexts, this study concludes that we are now part of an artificial culture entailing a matrix which, rather than separating minds and bodies, or humanity and the digital, reinforces the symbiotic connection between identities, bodies, and technologies.""--Provided by publisher.

"title : Ontological Turn - author : Martin Holbraadcategory : anthropologydescription : A new and often controversial theoretical orientation that resonates strongly with wider developments in contemporary philosophy and social theory, the so-called 'ontological turn' is receiving a great deal of attention in anthropology and cognate disciplines at present. This book provides the first anthropological exposition of this recent intellectual development. It traces the roots of the ontological turn in the history of anthropology and elucidates its emergence as a distinct theoretical orientation over the past few decades, showing how it has emerged in the work of Roy Wagner, Marilyn Strathern and Viveiros de Castro, as well a number of younger scholars. Distinguishing this trajectory of thinking from related attempts to put questions of ontology at the heart of anthropological research, the book articulates critically the key methodological and theoretical tenets of the ontological turn, its prime epistemological and political implications, and locates it in the broader intellectual landscape of contemporary social theory.

"title : Studies in Malaysian Oral and Musical Traditions - author : William P. Malmcategory : anthropologydescription : The first of two studies included is “Music in Kelantan, Malaysia and Some of Its Cultural Implications,” by William P. Malm. Kelantan is the northernmost province on the east coast of Malaysia. It is considered to be the most orthodox area in a nation whose state religion is Islam. At the same time it must be noted that it borders to the north with the Buddhist country of Thailand and to the west is the Malaysian province of Perak whose jungles and mountains contain many “pagan” tribal traditions. Beyond Perak is Kedah with its larger Indian and Chinese populations and to the south is Trengganu where some Indonesian traits are still to be found. It is in this context that Malm’s study of music is made.  The second study is “Professional Malay Story-Telling: Some Questions of Style and Presentation” by Amin Sweeney. In view of the hitherto almost exclusive concern with the content of such tales as those of Sang Kanchil or Pak Pandir, Sweeney throws some light on the form, style, and presentation of oral Malay literature, with special reference to that class of story-telling popularly known as penglipur lara, or what Winstedt termed “folk romances.”   Read more Read less"
"title : The Mertiyo Rathors of Merto, Rajasthan - author : Richard Sarancategory : anthropologydescription : The Me?tiyo Ra?ho?s of Me?to, Rajasthan is a treasure for scholars of Rajput history. Richard D. Saran and Norman P. Ziegler, whose contributions to Rajput studies are well known to specialists in the field, have given us a work of deep and exacting scholarship. It is the culmination of decades devoted to the study of Middle Marwari chronicles from Rajasthan. The sources translated here provide access to the fortunes of a branch of the Jodhpur royal family, and in doing so they illuminate the larger world of Rajputs in the middle period.  The Me?tiyo Ra?ho?s are significant for several reasons. Their story traces the emergence of a Rajput brotherhood into local prominence and follows the establishment of their kingdom on the eastern edge of Marva? as a defined territorial unit. The evolution of the Me?tiyos as a brotherhood passed through several clearly defined stages, including a relationship with the house of Jodhpur that ranged from mutual support among brothers to hostility and clear separation. A study of the Me?tiyos in this context provides a unique view of the formation of a strong and indpenedent Rajput cadet line, of the establishment and defense of a local territory, and of the internal relations among Rajput brotherhoods regarding issues of precedence, honor, patronage, and service.  The translations are accompanied by an extensive explanatory apparatus taking various forms, which includes a valuable essay on Rajput social organization, complete genealogies, and biographies of all the major personages of the chronicles.

"title : Reaction to World News Events and the Influence of Mass Media in an Indian Village - author : Thomas Poffenbergercategory : anthropologydescription : Our major research interest in the village under study was originally in the area of socialization practices, social change and variables related to fertility behavior. We had not planned a study of the diffusion of news events and villagers’ reactions to them. However, the Indian Government was considering the use of media for a major mass communication program, to propagate the idea of having small families through the use of family planning methods, and we believed it would be of value to examine any data that might be helpful in getting at least some feeling about what villagers read in the papers and what they heard on the radio, as well as their understanding of the information and their attitudes toward it. We subsequently asked questions about the use of mass media. [1]   Read more Read less"
"title : The Cultural Revolution - author : Michel Oksenbergcategory : anthropologydescription : The Chinese Communist system was from its very inception based on an inherent contradiction and tension, and the Cultural Revolution is the latest and most violent manifestation of that contradiction. Built into the very structure of the system was an inner conflict between the desiderata, the imperatives, and the requirements that technocratic modernization on the one hand and Maoist values and strategy on the other.  The Cultural Revolution collects four papers prepared for a research conference on the topic convened by the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies in March 1968. Michel Oksenberg opens the volume by examining the impact of the Cultural Revolution on occupational groups including peasants, industrial managers and workers, intellectuals, students, party and government officials, and the military. Carl Riskin is concerned with the economic effects of the revolution, taking up production trends in agriculture and industry, movements in foreign trade, and implications of Masoist economic policies for China’s economic growth. Robert A. Scalapino turns to China’s foreign policy behavior during this period, arguing that Chinese Communists in general, and Mao in particular, formed foreign policy with a curious combination of cosmic, utopian internationalism and practical ethnocentrism rooted both in Chinese tradition and Communist experience. Ezra F. Vogel closes the volume by exploring the structure of the conflict, the struggles between factions, and the character of those factions.   Read more Read less"
"title : Educated Youth and the Cultural Revolution in China - author : Martin Singercategory : anthropologydescription : The Cultural Revolution was an emotionally charged political awakening for the educated youth of China. Called upon by aging revolutionary Mao Tse-tung to assume a “vanguard” role in his new revolution to eliminate bourgeois revisionist influence in education, politics, and the arts, and to help to establish proletarian culture, habits, and customs, in a new Chinese society, educated young Chinese generally accepted this opportunity for meaningful and dramatic involvement in Chinese affairs. It also gave them the opportunity to gain recognition as a viable and responsible part of the Chinese polity. In the end, these revolutionary youths were not successful in proving their reliability. Too “idealistic” to compromise with the bourgeois way, their sense of moral rectitude also made it impossible for them to submerge their factional differences with other revolutionary mass organizations to achieve unity and consolidate proletarian victories. Many young revolutionaries were bitterly disillusioned by their own failures and those of other segments of the Chinese population and by the assignment of recent graduates to labor in rural communes.  Educated Youth and the Cultural Revolution in China reconstructs the events of the Cultural Revolution as they affected young people. Martin Singer integrates material from a range of factors and effects, including the characteristics of this generation of youths, the roles Mao called them to play, their resentment against the older generation, their membership in mass organizations, the educational system in which they were placed, and their perception that their skills were underutilized. To most educated young people in China, Singer concludes, the Cultural Revolution represented a traumatic and irreversible loss of political innocence, made yet more tragic by its allegiance to the unsuccessful campaign of an old revolutionary to preserve his legacy from the inevitable storms of history.

"title : The gentrification of nightlife and the right to the city - author : Laam Haecategory : anthropologydescription : ""In The Gentrification of Nightlife and the Right to the City, Hae explores how nightlife in New York City, long associated with various subcultures of social dancing, has been recently transformed as the city has undergone the gentrification of its space and the post-industrialization of its economy and society. This book offers a detailed analysis of the conflicts emerging between newly transplanted middle-class populations and different sectors of nightlife actors, and how these conflicts have led the NYC government to enforce ""Quality of Life"" policing over nightlife businesses. In particular, it provides a deep investigation of the zoning regulations that the municipal government has employed to control where certain types of nightlife can or cannot be located. Hae demonstrates the ways in which these struggles over nightlife have led to the ""gentrification of nightlife,"" while infringing on urban inhabitants' rights of access to spaces of diverse urban subcultures, their ""right to the city."" The author also connects these struggles to the widely documented phenomenon of the increasing militarization of social life and space in contemporary cities, and the right to the city movements that have emerged in response. The story presented here involves dynamic and often contradictory interactions between different anti/pro-nightlife actors, illustrating what ""actually existing"" gentrification and post-industrialization looks like, and providing an urgent example for experts in related fields to consider as part of a re-theorization of gentrification and post-industrialization""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Constant battles - author : Steven A. LeBlanccategory : anthropologydescription : With armed conflict in the Persian Gulf now upon us, Harvard archaeologist Steven LeBlanc takes a long-term view of the nature and roots of war, presenting a controversial thesis: The notion of the ""noble savage"" living in peace with one another and in harmony with nature is a fantasy. In Constant Battles: The Myth of the Peaceful, Noble Savage, LeBlanc contends that warfare and violent conflict have existed throughout human history, and that humans have never lived in ecological balance with nature.  The start of the second major U.S. military action in the Persian Gulf, combined with regular headlines about spiraling environmental destruction, would tempt anyone to conclude that humankind is fast approaching a catastrophic end. But as LeBlanc brilliantly argues, the archaeological record shows that the warfare and ecological destruction we find today fit into patterns of human behavior that have gone on for millions of years.  Constant Battles surveys human history in terms of social organization-from hunter gatherers, to tribal agriculturalists, to more complex societies. LeBlanc takes the reader on his own digs around the world -- from New Guinea to the Southwestern U.S. to Turkey -- to show how he has come to discover warfare everywhere at every time. His own fieldwork combined with his archaeological, ethnographic, and historical research, presents a riveting account of how, throughout human history, people always have outgrown the carrying capacity of their environment, which has led to war.  Ultimately, though, LeBlanc's point of view is reassuring and optimistic. As he explains the roots of warfare in human history, he also demonstrates that warfare today has far less impact than it did in the past. He also argues that, as awareness of these patterns and the advantages of modern technology increase, so does our ability to avoid war in the future.   Read more Read less"
"title : Museum Object Lessons for the Digital Age - author : Haidy Geismarcategory : anthropologydescription : Museum Object Lessons for the Digital Age explores the nature of digital objects in museums, asking us to question our assumptions about the material, social and political foundations of digital practices. Through four wide-ranging chapters, each focused on a single object ? a box, pen, effigy and cloak ? this short, accessible book explores the legacies of earlier museum practices of collection, older forms of media (from dioramas to photography), and theories of how knowledge is produced in museums on a wide range of digital projects. Swooping from Ethnographic to Decorative Arts Collections, from the Google Art Project to bespoke digital experiments, Haidy Geismar explores the object lessons contained in digital form and asks what they can tell us about both the past and the future. Drawing on the author?s extensive experience working with collections across the world, Geismar argues for an understanding of digital media as material, rather than immaterial, and advocates for a more nuanced, ethnographic and historicised view of museum digitisation projects than those usually adopted in the celebratory accounts of new media in museums. By locating the digital as part of a longer history of material engagements, transformations and processes of translation, this book broadens our understanding of the reality effects that digital technologies create, and of how digital media can be mobilised in different parts of the world to very different effects.

"title : Sacred Realms - author : Richard L. Warmscategory : anthropologydescription : This comprehensive and engaging introduction to the anthropology of religion brings together a rich and balanced collection of classic and contemporary readings. Ideal for courses in the anthropology of religion or comparative religion, this exceptional anthology not only gives students the tools to analyze and comprehend religion but also enables them to consider religion's major role in contemporary world affairs.  Organized topically, Sacred Realms: Readings in the Anthropology of Religion, Second Edition, covers twelve major areas in faith, religion, and belief. Demonstrating the breadth and variety of human religious experience, the essays are written by authors from diverse ethnic and national backgrounds and include vivid ethnographic examples drawn from field studies around the world.  The readings range from classic contributions by Bronislaw Malinowski, Horace Miner, and Anthony F. C. Wallace to more recent selections including one on the Rajneeshee by Charles Lindholm and articles on Sufism, witches, and American raves.  The volume concludes with a unique section by the editors that describes the basic facets of five of the world's most influential religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  The editors also provide helpful background material throughout; their general introduction encourages students to approach religion as an objective human experience rather than from the perspective of their own upbringings, while overviews to each of the text's six parts place subjects in context and highlight key issues. Essay introductions identify the author's perspective, the article's major points, and the questions the essay raises.  New to the second edition of Sacred Realms is a section on the intersection of religion and politics, which includes a classic article by Raymond Firth as well as recent articles on issues in Korea and the Middle East. This edition also features a world map at the front of the book--referencing locations in each essay, by number--and a glossary of terms at the end of the book.

"title : Theatre & War - author : Nandita Dineshcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Nandita Dinesh places Kipling’s """"six honest serving-men"""" (who, what, when, where, why, how) in productive conversation with her own experiences in conflict zones across the world to offer a theoretical and practical reflection on making theatre in times of war. This timely and important book weaves together Dinesh’s personal narrative with the public story of modern conflict, illustrating as it does, the importance of theatre as a force for ethical deliberation and social justice. In it Dinesh asks how theatre might intervene in times and places of conflict and how we might reflect on such interventions. In pursuit of answers, Theatre and War adopts the methods of auto-ethnography, positioning the theatrical practitioner at the heart of conflict zones in northern Uganda, Guatemala, Northern Ireland, Mexico, Rwanda, Kenya, Nagaland, and Kashmir. No longer a detached observer, the researcher and practitioner has to be able to meld theory with practice; to speak to ‘doing’, without undervaluing the importance of ‘thinking about doing’. Each chapter approaches the need for a synthesis of theory and practice by way of a term of inquiry―Why, Where, Who, What, When―and each is equipped with a set of unflinchingly honest field notes that are designed to reveal some of the ‘hows’ from the author’s own repertoire: questions and issues that were encountered during her own theatrical undertakings, along with first hand reflection on the complexities, potential, and challenges that attended her global work in community theatre. Within these notes are strategies that give the reader a practical insight into how the discussion might find its footing on the ground of war.    The range and scope of this book make it required reading for those interested in theatre―practitioners, researchers, and students alike—as well as those seeking to understand the applications of the arts for ethics, politics, and education.

"title : Boy-Wives and Female Husbands - author : Stephen O. Murraycategory : anthropologydescription : From Amazon.com:  Claims concerning the presence and status of homosexuality in historic African cultures have become central points of contention in debates among contemporary African Americans. Some of those involved in the debate have even asserted that the original languages of Africa contained no words for gay or lesbian, therefore concluding that they did not exist. As the first work of its kind on the subject, Boy-Wives and Female-Husbands answers an urgent need for accurate, well-researched, and balanced work on African sexuality. It offers perspectives from the fields of anthropology and history, along with extensive evidence from ethnographic and literary sources. The essays explore such topics as woman-woman marriages, early reports of Malagasy ""berdaches,"" male homosexuality in contemporary West Africa, alternative gender identities among the Swahili, the regulation of sexuality in colonial Zimbabwe, and the portrayals of homosexuality in modern African literature. Bound to be an invaluable resource for discussions of traditional and contemporary African cultures, Boy-Wives and Female-Husbands is a book whose time has clearly come.   Read more Read less"
"title : Anthropologies of Cancer in Transnational Worlds - author : Nancy J. Burkecategory : anthropologydescription : Cancer is a transnational condition involving the unprecedented flow of health information, technologies, and people across national borders. Such movement raises questions about the nature of therapeutic citizenship, how and where structurally vulnerable populations obtain care, and the political geography of blame associated with this disease. This volume brings together cutting-edge anthropological research carried out across North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia, representing low-, middle- and high-resource countries with a diversity of national health care systems. Contributors ethnographically map the varied nature of cancer experiences and articulate the multiplicity of meanings that survivorship, risk, charity and care entail. They explore institutional frameworks shaping local responses to cancer and underlying political forces and structural variables that frame individual experiences. Of particular concern is the need to interrogate underlying assumptions of research designs that may lead to the naturalizing of hidden agendas or intentions. Running throughout the chapters, moreover, are considerations of moral and ethical issues related to cancer treatment and research. Thematic emphases include the importance of local biologies in the framing of cancer diagnosis and treatment protocols, uncertainty and ambiguity in definitions of biosociality, shifting definitions of patienthood, and the sociality of care and support.

"title : Selfie - author : Will Storrcategory : anthropologydescription : We live in an age of perfectionism. Every day, we're bombarded with the beautiful, successful, slim, socially-conscious and extroverted individual that our culture has decided is the perfect self. We see this person constantly in shop windows, in newspapers, on the television, at the movies and all over our social media. We berate ourselves when we don't match up to them--when we're too fat, too old, too poor, or too sad. This cycle can be extremely bad for us. In recent years, psychologists have even begun to think that many people take their own lives because of the impossible standards that are set for who they ought to be. Will Storr began to wonder about this perfect self that torments so many of us. Who, actually, is this person? Why does it hold such power over us? Could it be humanity's deadliest idea? And, if so, is there any way we can break its spell? To find out, Storr takes us on a journey from the shores of Ancient Greece, through the Christian Middle Ages, the encounter groups of 1960s California and self-esteem evangelists of the late twentieth century to modern-day America, where research suggests today's young people are in the grip of an epidemic of narcissism. He'll tell the strange story of the individualist Western self from its birth on the Aegean to the era of hyper-individualistic neoliberalism in which we find ourselves today. ""Selfie"" reveals, for the first time, the epic tale of the person we all know so intimately...because it's us.   Read more Read less"

"title : Baby, you are my religion - author : Marie Cartiercategory : anthropologydescription : This book argues that American butch-femme bar culture of the mid-20th century should be interpreted as a sacred space for its community. Before Stonewall when homosexuals were still deemed mentally ill, these bars were the only place where many could have any community at all. This book explores this community as a site of a lived corporeal theology and political space. It reveals that religious institutions such as the Metropolitan Community Church were founded in such bars, that traditional and non-traditional religious activities took place there, and that religious ceremonies such as marriage were often conducted within the bars by staff. It examines how these bars became not only ecclesiastical sites but also provided the fertile ground for the birth of the struggle for gay and lesbian civil rights before Stonewall.

Archaeologies of Sexuality is a timely and pioneering work. It presents a strong, diverse body of scholarship which draws on locations as varied as medieval England, the ancient Maya kingdoms, New Kingdom Egypt, prehistoric Europe, and convict-era Australia, demonstrating the challenges and rewards of integrating the study of sex and sexuality within archaeology.  This volume, with contributions by many leading archaeologists, will serve both as an essential introduction and a valuable reference tool for students and academics.   Read more Read less"
"title : Antropología estructural - author : Claude Lévi-Strausscategory : anthropologydescription : En esta obra, Claude Lévi-Strauss expone y lleva a la práctica el método estructural a cuyo desarrollo va íntimamente unido su nombre. Al abordar los grandes problemas de la antropología social -de las reglas del parentesco y del matrimonio a la prohibición del incesto y la exogamia, pasando por los ritos y prácticas de la magia-, el texto analiza los problemas metodológicos que plantea el estructuralismo, y define e ilustra la ambición del autor respecto a plantear un verdadero análisis científico de los fenómenos humanos sin traicionarlos, es decir, sin hacerles perder nada de su riqueza ni de los sutiles matices derivados de su diversidad. De ahí que, junto a aspectos de la realidad social -tan complejos que el observador debe contentarse con describirlos-, haya otros que el análisis estructural logra alcanzar y cuya regularidad pone de manifiesto. De este modo, la etnografía -ayudada por la historia, la lingüística, la sociología, la psicología y el psicoanálisis-contribuye a introducir métodos rigurosos al amparo de los cuales quizás un día las ciencias humanas logren la categoría de ciencias de pleno derecho.

"title : Complexities - author : Susan McKinnoncategory : anthropologydescription : ""Recent Years Have Seen a growing impetus to explain social life almost exclusively in biological and mechanistic terms, and to dismiss cultural meaning and difference. Daily we read assertions that everything from disease to morality - not to mention the presumed characteristics of race, gender, and sexuality - can be explained by reference primarily to genetics and our evolutionary past."" ""Complexities mobilizes experts from several fields of anthropology - cultural, archaeological, linguistic, and biological - to offer a compelling challenge to the resurgence of reductive theories of human biological and social life. This book presents evidence to contest such theories and to provide a multifaceted account of the complexity and variability of the human condition. Charting a course that moves beyond any simple opposition between nature and nurture, Complexities argues that a nonreductive perspective has important implications for how we understand and foster human potential.

"title : Plagues and epidemics - author : Ann Herringcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Until recently, plagues were thought to belong in the ancient past. Now there are deep worries about global pandemics. This book presents views from anthropology about this much publicized and complex problem. The authors take us to places where epidemics are erupting, waning, or gone and to other places where they have not yet arrived, but where a frightening story-line is already in place. They explore public health bureaucracies and political arenas where the power lies to make decisions about what is, and is not, an epidemic. They look back into global history to uncover disease trends and look ahead to a future of expanding plagues within the context of climate change. The chapters are written from a range of perspectives, from the science of modelling epidemics to the social science of understanding them. Patterns emerge when people are engulfed by diseases labeled as epidemics but which have the hallmarks of plague. There are cycles of shame and blame, stigma, isolation of the sick, fear of contagion, and end-of-the-world scenarios. Plague, it would seem, is still among us""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Monkey Trouble - author : Christopher Petersoncategory : anthropologydescription : Engaging with recent theoretical developments in speculative realism and object oriented ontology, ape and parrot language studies, along with literary texts by J.M. Coetzee, Charles Chesnutt, and Walt Whitman, and films by Alfonso Cuarón and Lars von Trier, Monkey Trouble argues that the turn toward immanence in contemporary posthumanism promotes a cosmocracy that absolves one from engaging in those discriminatory decisions that condition hospitality as such. Anthropocentrism cannot be displaced through a logic of reversal that elevates immanence above transcendence, horizontality over verticality. This decentering must cultivate instead a human/nonhuman relationality that affirms the immanent transcendency spawned by our phantasmatic humanness.   Read more Read less"
"title : Tourism, magic and modernity - author : David Picardcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Drawing from extended fieldwork in La Réunion, in the Indian Ocean, the author suggests an innovative re-reading of different concepts of magic that emerge in the global cultural economics of tourism. Following the making and unmaking of the tropical island tourism destination of La Réunion, he demonstrates how destinations are transformed into magical pleasure gardens in which human life is cultivated for tourist consumption. Like a gardener would cultivate flowers, local development policy, nature conservation, and museum initiatives dramatise local social life so as to evoke modernist paradigms of time, beauty and nature. Islanders who live in this 'human garden' are thus placed in the ambivalent role of 'human flowers', embodying ideas of authenticity and biblical innocence, but also of history and social life in perpetual creolisation.""--P.

"title : Heritage and Festivals in Europe - author : Ullrich Kockelcategory : anthropologydescription : Heritage and Festivals in Europe critically investigates the purpose, reach and effects of heritage festivals. Providing a comprehensive and detailed analysis of comparatively selected aspects of intangible cultural heritage, the volume demonstrates how such heritage is mobilised within events that have specific agency, particularly in the production and consumption of intrinsic and instrumental benefits for tourists, local communities and performers.  Bringing together experts from a wide range of disciplines, the volume presents case studies from across Europe that consider many different varieties of heritage festivals. Focusing primarily on the popular and institutional practices of heritage making, the book addresses the gap between discourses of heritage at an official level and cultural practice at the local and regional level. Contributors to the volume also study the different factors influencing the sustainable development of tradition as part of intangible cultural heritage at the micro- and meso-levels, and examine underlying structures that are common across different countries.  Heritage and Festivals in Europe takes a multidisciplinary approach and as such, should be of interest to scholars and students in the fields of heritage studies, tourism, performing arts, cultural studies and identity studies. Policymakers and practitioners throughout Europe should also find much to interest them within the pages of this volume.   Read more Read less"
"title : Magic, science and religion: and other essays - author : Bronisław Malinowskicategory : anthropologydescription : The Book    Malinowski's research has had a profound impact on the study of magical and religious practice in both the modern and ancient worlds, along with the works of Mauss.  Three famous Malinowski essays. Malinowski, one of the all-time great anthropologists, had a talent for bringing together in single comprehension the warm reality of human living with the cool abstractions of science. His pages have become an almost indispensable link between the knowing of exotic and remote people with theoretical knowledge about humankind. An important collection of three of his most famous essays, Magic, Science and Religion offers readers a set of concepts about religion, magic, science, rite and myth in the course of forming vivid impressions and understandings of the Trobrianders of New Guinea.  About the Author    Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942), Anglo-Polish anthropologist, was born in what was then Austrian Poland of a long line of Polish nobility and landed gentry. He was educated at the Polish University of Cracow, from which he received his doctorate in 1908 with the highest honors of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He also studied at the University of Leipzig and later went on to London, where from 1910 he was associated with the London School of Economics. From 1914 to 1918 Dr. Malinowski was a member of the Robert Mond Expedition to New Guinea and North Melanesia, and it was the research done on this expedition that was later published in Argonauts of the Western Pacific. In later years Dr. Malinowski taught at the University of London, at Cornell University, and at Yale University. (Amazon)   Read more Read less"

"title : Two Spirit People - author : Lester B. Browncategory : anthropologydescription : Two Spirit People is the first-ever look at social science research exploration into the lives of American Indian lesbian women and gay men. Editor Lester B. Brown posits six gender styles in traditional American Indian culture: men and women, not-men and not-women (persons of one biological sex assuming the identity of the opposite sex in some form), and gays and lesbians. He brings together chapters that emphasize American Indian spirituality, present new perspectives, and provide readers with a beginning understanding of the place of lesbian, gay, and bisexual Indians within American Indian culture and within American society. This beginning will help you understand these unique people and the special challenges and multiple prejudices they face.  Traditionally, American Indian cultures showed great respect and honor for alternative gender styles, since these were believed to be part of the sacred web of life. If the Great Spirit chose to create alternative sexualities or gender roles, who was bold enough to oppose such power? If one’s spiritual quest revealed one’s identity to be that of not-woman, not-man, gay, or lesbian, who should defy their calling? The interpretation of contemporary American Indian religions that gay American Indians retain sacred rights within Indian cultures, and that they can share this gift with others, have implications for therapy, identity formation, social movements, and general human relations.

"title : Immigrant Performance in the Labour Market - author : Bram Lanceecategory : anthropologydescription : To what extent can different forms of social capital help immigrants make headway on the labour market? An answer to this pressing question begins here. Taking the Netherlands and Germany as case studies, the book identifies two forms of social capital that may work to increase employment, income and occupational status and, conversely, decrease unemployment. New insights into the concepts of bonding and bridging arise through quantitative research methods, using longitudinal and crosssectional data. Referring to a dense network with 'thick' trust, bonding is measured as family ties, co-ethnic ties and trust in the family. Bridging is seen in terms of interethnic ties, thus implying a crosscutting network with 'thin' trust. Immigrant Performance in the Labour Market reveals that although bonding allows immigrants to get by, bridging enables them to get ahead.   Read more Read less"

"title : Corpse - author : Jessica Snyder Sachscategory : anthropologydescription : When detectives come upon a murder victim, there's one thing they want to know above all else: When did the victim die? The answer can narrow a group of suspects, make or break an alibi, even assign a name to an unidentified body. But outside the fictional world of murder mysteries, time-of-death determinations have remained infamously elusive, bedeviling criminal investigators throughout history. Armed with an array of high-tech devices and tests, the world's best forensic pathologists are doing their best to shift the balance, but as Jessica Snyder Sachs demonstrates so eloquently in Corpse, this is a case in which nature might just trump technology: Plants, chemicals, and insects found near the body are turning out to be the fiercest weapons in our crime-fighting arsenal. In this highly original book, Sachs accompanies an eccentric group of entomologists, anthropologists, biochemists, and botanists--a new kind of biological ""Mod Squad""--on some of their grisliest, most intractable cases. She also takes us into the courtroom, where ""post-O.J."" forensic science as a whole is coming under fire and the new multidisciplinary art of forensic ecology is struggling to establish its credibility. Corpse is the fascinating story of the 2000 year search to pinpoint time of death. It is also the terrible and beautiful story of what happens to our bodies when we die.   Read more Read less"

"title : Anthropology of Tobacco - author : Andrew Russellcategory : anthropologydescription : Tobacco has become one of the most widely used and traded commodities on    the planet. Reflecting contemporary anthropological interest in material culture    studies, Anthropology of Tobacco makes the plant the centre of its own contentious,    global story in which, instead of a passive commodity, tobacco becomes a    powerful player in a global adventure involving people, corporations and public    health.    Bringing together a range of perspectives from the social and natural    sciences as well as the arts and humanities, Anthropology of Tobacco weaves    stories together from a range of historical, cross-cultural and literary sources    and empirical research. These combine with contemporary anthropological    theories of agency and cross-species relationships to offer fresh perspectives on    how an apparently humble plant has progressed to world domination, and the    consequences of it having done so. It also considers what needs to happen if,    as some public health advocates would have it, we are seriously to imagine ?a    world without tobacco?.

"title : The Christian view of man - author : J. Gresham Machencategory : anthropologydescription : The question: What is Man? which arose centuries ago in the Psalms remains one of the most vital issues faced by present-day man. Bewildered by technological advance, alienated from the convictions and lifestyle of his forefathers, modern man has lost his place in the universe. The echoes of his bewilderment can be heard everywhere, from the city graffiti to the rock songs, subcultures and new religions of our time. Yet there is an answer to man's identity crisis. Man is made by God, in his image, for his glory. This truth with all its implications, is the theme of J. Gresham Machen's popular presentation of The Christian View of Man. It explains, for Christians and non-Christians alike, how the Bible serves as a mirror to show us who we are. In simple yet careful language, Machen deals with such subjects as creation, man as the image of God, the fall, sin, God's providence and care, and God's restoring grace. - Back cover.

How do people who do not share expectations about how they should behave build new expectations through participating in conversation? Starting from a view of language-society dynamics as enregisterment, Zane Goebel synthesizes a wide range of humanities scholarship with contemporary linguistic anthropology to explore how language is used in this contact setting to build and present identities, expectations and social relations.

"title : The spiritual senses - author : Paul L. Gavrilyukcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Is it possible to see, hear, touch, smell and taste God? How do we understand the biblical promise that the 'pure in heart' will 'see God'? Christian thinkers as diverse as Origen of Alexandria, Bonaventure, Jonathan Edwards and Hans Urs von Balthasar have all approached these questions in distinctive ways by appealing to the concept of the 'spiritual senses'. In focusing on the Christian tradition of the 'spiritual senses', this book discusses how these senses relate to the physical senses and the body, and analyzes their relationship to mind, heart, emotions, will, desire and judgement. The contributors illuminate the different ways in which classic Christian authors have treated this topic, and indicate the epistemological and spiritual import of these understandings. The concept of the 'spiritual senses' is thereby importantly recovered for contemporary theological anthropology and philosophy of religion""--  ""In this chapter I argue for a reassessment of current academic opinion regarding the theme of the spiritual senses in the writings of Origen of Alexandria (c. 185--c. 254). Specifically, John Dillon has claimed that it is exclusively in Origen's late works that one finds a 'proper' doctrine of the spiritual senses (the crucial features of which will be discussed below).1 Dillon argues that Origen's early works, by contrast, evince only a metaphorical use of the language of sensation.2 The early Origen, according to this reading, is not actually describing the perception of spiritual realities, as is typically thought. Instead, in his early writings Origen uses terms such as 'seeing' and 'hearing' in a figurative manner to describe 'understanding', placing no particular value on the sensory dimension to the terms. In contrast to this assessment, however, I argue here that unexamined aspects of Origen's early writings in fact demonstrate noteworthy continuities between his early and late uses of sensory language. In particular, portions of Origen's early scriptural commentaries and Deprincipiis show that his 'doctrine of the spiritual senses' emerges much earlier than has been recently supposed""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Persons, powers, and pluralities - author : Eric G. Flettcategory : anthropologydescription : Torrance's work suggests that Christian assumptions in the areas of God, creation, and humanity had an important influence upon the development of Western scientific culture. This book develops each of these areas of Torrance's thought in order to articulate a theology of culture rooted in a Christian understanding of God as triune, creation as contingent, and human persons as stewards created in the image of God. Drawn together, these three areas of Torrance's thought suggest that human culture and cultural plurality ultimately originate in the creation of a triune God, mediated through the creative activity of the human creature as it engages in a contingent created order in its attempts to foster human flourishing and to bear witness to its creator. The result is not only a unique contribution to the emerging secondary material on Torrance's work, but also a contribution to the field of theology of culture as a systematic locus in its own right.

"title : Spiking neuron models - author : Wulfram Gerstnercategory : anthropologydescription : Neurons in the brain communicate by short electrical pulses, the so-called action potentials or spikes. How can we understand the process of spike generation? How can we understand information transmission by neurons? What happens if thousands of neurons are coupled together in a seemingly random network? How does the network connectivity determine the activity patterns? And, vice versa, how does the spike activity influence the connectivity pattern? These questions are addressed in this introduction to spiking neurons aimed at those taking courses in computational neuroscience, theoretical biology, biophysics, or neural networks. The approach will suit students of physics, mathematics, or computer science; it will also be useful for biologists who are interested in mathematical modelling. The text is enhanced by many worked examples and illustrations. There are no mathematical prerequisites beyond what the audience would meet as undergraduates: more advanced techniques are introduced in an elementary, concrete fashion when needed.

While town living fostered improvements in social and economic development, numerous unintended consequences jeopardized the success of this planning initiative. As a result, the Bedouin community endured excessive hardship and rapid change, abandoning its nomadic lifestyle and traditions in response to the economic, political, and social pressure from the State?and received very little in return.

With attention to both biological family relations as well as in-law and step-relations, it provides an overview of existing studies centred on intergenerational relations – particularly grandparenting – that incorporate social science and evolutionary family theories. This evolutionary social science approach to intergenerational family relations goes well beyond the traditional nature versus nurture distinction.

Why, in this age of female empowerment, do we continue to judge them so harshly? Martin takes us on a fascinating journey to reveal the unexpected evolutionary legacy and social realities that drive female faithlessness, while laying bare our motivations to contain women who step out. From recent data suggesting women may struggle more than men with sexual exclusivity, to Martin's assertion that female sexual autonomy is the ultimate metric of gender equality, this book will change the way you think about women and sex. -- adapted from jacket   Read more Read less"

"title : Implementing Ethics in Educational Ethnography - author : Hugh Bushercategory : anthropologydescription : Providing theoretical grounding, case studies and practical solutions, Implementing Ethics in Educational Ethnography examines how researchers can overcome ethical dilemmas associated with and encountered during ethnographic research. From the initial stages of research design such as consideration from regulatory bodies, through research occurring in the field to project completion and reporting, it explores many of the factors associated with ensuring culturally sensitive and ethical studies.  The book covers key questions including:  What can researchers expect of ethical review boards?    Where and with whom should dialogue take place about ethicality within research?    What effect does a research focus have on regulation and research practice?    What is the effect of context on ethical practices?    Does the positionality of a researcher have an effect on ethical practices?    How do we ensure that ethicality supports the trustworthiness of research projects?    Using a range of international case studies, Implementing Ethics in Educational Ethnography provides researchers and students with invaluable details about how to navigate the field, ensuring that they can sustain good ethical practice throughout the life of a research project.

"title : City and soul in divided societies - author : Scott A. Bollenscategory : anthropologydescription : ""In this unique book Scott A. Bollens combines personal narrative with academic analysis in telling the story of inflammatory nationalistic and ethnic conflict in nine cities - Jerusalem, Beirut, Belfast, Johannesburg, Nicosia, Sarajevo, Mostar, Bilbao, and Barcelona. Reporting on 17 years of research and over 240 interviews with political leaders, planners, architects, community representatives, and academics, he blends personal reflections, reportage from a wealth of original interviews, and the presentation of hard data in a multidimensional and interdisciplinary exploration of these urban environments of damage, trauma, healing, and repair. City and Soul reveals what it is like living and working in these cities, going inside the head of the researcher. This approach extends the reader's understanding of these places and connects more intimately with the lived urban experience. Bollens observes that a city disabled by nationalistic strife looks like a callous landscape of securitized space, divisions and wounds, frozen in time and in place. Yet, the soul in these cities perseveres. Written for general readers and academic specialists alike, City and Soul integrates facts, opinions, photographs, and observations in original ways in order to illuminate the substantial challenges of living in, and governing, polarized and unsettled cities""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Origin Legend of the Navaho Flintway - author : Berard Hailecategory : anthropologydescription : Franciscan Father Berard Haile started out as a missionary among the Navajo in the early 1900s but during his decades of service became known for his extensive documentation of the Navajo language and culture. He was later hired as a research associate in the U of C anthropology department.  This text and translation lives up to the high standards previously set by the author. The text is minutely complete. For no other chant do we have an absolutely complete record of songs and prayers. If the music were recorded and if there were a full description of the details of motor habits of practitioners, this volume would almost suffice to permit a native speaker to conduct Flintway without blemish. As always, Father Berard is alive to variations and, in addition to the complete Version A, includes enough of Version B to give the reader a sense for the range of disagreement. The translation is a marvel of precision and of sympathetic sensitivity.  To the specialist this publication is an inexhaustible storehouse of hitherto undescribed items, traits, and patterns. The more general student of American Indian cultures will also find much to engage him.   Read more Read less"
"title : Adat and Indigeneity in Indonesia - Culture and Entitlements between Heteronomy and Self-Ascription - author : Brigitta Hauser-Schäublincategory : anthropologydescription : A number of UN conventions and declarations (on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions and the World Heritage Conventions) can be understood as instruments of international governance to promote democracy and social justice worldwide. In Indonesia (as in many other countries), these international agreements have encouraged the self-assertion of communities that had been oppressed and deprived of their land, especially during the New Order regime (1966-1998). More than 2,000 communities in Indonesia who define themselves as masyarakat adat or ?indigenous peoples? had already joined the Indigenous Peoples? Alliance of the Archipelago? (AMAN) by 2013. In their efforts to gain recognition and selfdetermination, these communities are supported by international donors and international as well as national NGOs by means of development programmes. In the definition of masyarakat adat, ?culture? or adat plays an important role in the communities? self-definition. Based on particular characteristics of their adat, the asset of their culture, they try to distinguish themselves from others in order to substantiate their claims for the restitution of their traditional rights and property (namely land and other natural resources) from the state. The authors of this volume investigate how differently structured communities - socially, politically and religiously - and associations reposition themselves vis-à-vis others, especially the state, not only by drawing on adat for achieving particular goals, but also dignity and a better future.

In this pathbreaking book Loretta Cormier integrates a wide range of data from molecular biology, ethnoprimatology, epidemiology, ecology, anthropology, and other fields to reveal the intimate relationships between culture and environment that shape the trajectory of a parasite. She argues against the entrenched distinction between human and non-human malarias, using ethnoprimatology to develop a new understanding of cross-species exchange. She also shows how current human-environment interactions, including deforestation and development, create the potential for new forms of malaria to threaten human populations.

"title : Ethnic cleansing in the Balkans: nationalism and the destruction of tradition - author : Cathie Carmichaelcategory : anthropologydescription : Ethnic Cleansing in the Balkans looks at the phenomenon of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans over the last two hundred years. It argues that the events of the last two hundred years can be demystified, that the South East of Europe was not destined to become violent and that constructions of the Balkans as endemically violent misses a important political point and historical point.This book claims that ethnic cleansing is a problem that is linked to nationalism rather than being restricted to the Balkans. As nationalism spread from Central Europe to the Ottoman regions of Europe, national ideologies replaced the older religious and political affiliations. Muslims came to be regarded as potentially disloyal minorities in Bosnia and elsewhere. In addition, national divisions harking back to the Middle Ages divided the other ethnic groups who became increasingly mutually antagonistic eventually leading to minorities being persecuted and driven out, with many victims mistreated and murdered in a demonstrably cruel fashion. At the beginning of the twenty first century, there are very few multiethnic regions left in South Eastern Europe and large diaspora communities of ethnically cleansed peoples.Carmichael provides an account of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans as a single historical phenomenon and brings together a vast array of primary and secondary sources to produce a concise and accessible argument. This book will be of interest to students and researchers of European studies, history and comparative politics.   Read more Read less"

"title : Outrage - author : Paul Rolliercategory : anthropologydescription : Whether spurred by religious images or academic history books, hardly a day goes by in South Asia without an incident or court case occurring as a result of hurt religious feelings. The sharp rise in blasphemy accusations over the past few decades calls for an investigation into why offence politics has become so pronounced, and why it is observable across religious and political differences.  Outrage offers an interdisciplinary study of this growing trend. Bringing together researchers in Anthropology, Religious Studies, Languages, South Asia Studies and History, all with rich experience in the variegated ways in which religion and politics intersect in this region, the volume presents a fine-grained analysis that navigates and unpacks the religious sensitivities and political concerns under discussion.

"title : European Immigrations - author : Marek Okólskicategory : anthropologydescription : This book makes an essential contribution to understanding the dynamics of contemporary immigrant inflows and integration in Europe. Though embracing a Continent-wide outlook on migration processes, it accounts, in particular, for Southern and Eastern European perspectives. This is accomplished by analysing the long-term transition countries undergo from net emigration to net immigration, as well as developments in their migrant inflows, integration and policy. Balance is achieved between describing the common European experience and the intra- and inter-regional differences characterising migration’s underlying factors and trends. This volume is one of few attempts to conceive of the ‘Old Continent’ as a common economic and cultural space that fully incorporates its eastern part, while still viewing post-enlargement Europe as an area that – despite nation-specific histories – maintains a high degree of social and political coherence.  The book is very comprehensive, with deep insights into aspects of immigration  throughout different periods and changing socio-economic environments. Contents come from new empirical evidence, specially designed and collected. A great asset is the mix of authors, representing several academic centres across Europe yet pursuing a common vision of European migration, past, present and future.  Dit boek analyseert de instroom en integratie van immigranten in Europa, waarbij alle aspecten van de immigratie gedurende uiteenlopende perioden en in veranderende sociaaleconomische omstandigheden aan bod komen. Daarbij wordt Europa beschouwd als één economische en culturele entiteit, met een grote mate van onderlinge sociale en politieke samenhang. De auteur heeft echter ook oog voor de regionale verschillen die bepalend zijn voor de onderliggende factoren en trends.   Read more Read less"
"title : Law and Kingship in Thailand During the Reign of King Chulalongkorn - author : David Engelcategory : anthropologydescription : This essay originated in an attempt to bring together the study of law and Thai history in a description of the transformation of Thailand during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as seen from a legal point of view. The resulting work is based for the most part upon those royal enactments from 1873 to 1910 which seemed most crucially to affect the executive, legislative, and judicial functions of the king and the rights of private citizens.

"title : Women and Public Life in Early Meiji Japan - author : Mara Patessiocategory : anthropologydescription : Women and Public Life in Early Meiji Japan focuses on women’s activities in the new public spaces of Meiji Japan. With chapters on public, private, and missionary schools for girls, their students, and teachers, on social and political groups women created, on female employment, and on women’s participation in print media, this book offers a new perspective on nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japanese history. Women’s founding of and participation in conflicting discourses over the value of women in Meiji public life demonstrate that during this period active and vocal women were everywhere, that they did not meekly submit to the dictates of the government and intellectuals over what women could or should do, and that they were fully integrated in the production of Meiji culture.  Mara Patessio shows that the study of women is fundamental not only in order to understand fully the transformations of the Meiji period, but also to understand how later generations of women could successfully move the battle forward. Women and Public Life in Early Meiji Japan is essential reading for all students and teachers of 19th- and early 20th-century Japanese history and is of interest to scholars of women’s history more generally.

"title : Citizens and Groups in Contemporary China - author : Victor C. Falkenheimcategory : anthropologydescription : Citizens and Groups in Contemporary China began with two symposia held in 1977 and 1978. The first, a workshop on “The Pursuit of Interest in China,” was held in August 1977 at the University of Michigan, and was organized by Michel Oksenberg and Richard Baum. It was supported by a grant from the Joint Committee on Contemporary China of the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies, using funds provided by the Andrew Mellon Foundation. Its principal goal was to use detailed case studies to explore the relevance of interest group approaches to the study of Chinese politics. The second, a panel organized by the editor for the 1978 Chicago meeting of the Association of Asian Studies, sought to apply participatory approaches to the role of social groups in the Chinese political process. The striking degree of overlap in the focus, methodology, and participants in both meetings suggested to a number of the paper writers that there was a need for a more eclectic approach which would focus simultaneously on individual and group actors. The recognition that a volume based on such an approach might serve the needs of students and scholars seeking to examine the dynamics of informal influence and power in China was the stimulus for publishing the studies presented here in book form.

"title : Critical Studies in Indian Grammarians I - author : Madhav M. Deshpandecategory : anthropologydescription : In the historical study of the Indian grammarian tradition, a line of demarcation can often be drawn between the conformity of a system with the well-known grammar of Pa?ini and the explanatory effectiveness of that system. One element of Pa?ini’s grammar that scholars have sometimes struggled to bring across this line of demarcation is the theory of homogeneity, or savar?ya, which concerns the final consonants in Pa?ini’s reference catalog, as well as phonetic similarities between sounds. While modern Sanskrit scholars understand how to interpret and apply Pa?ini’s homogeneity, they still find it necessary to unravel the history of varying interpretations of the theory in subsequent grammars.  Madhav Deshpande’s The Theory of Homogeneity provides a thorough account of the historical development of the theory. Proceeding first to study this conception in the Pa?inian tradition, Deshpande then passes on to other grammatical systems. Deshpande gives attention not only to the definitions of homogeneity in these systems but also the implementation of the theory in those respective systems. Even where definitions are identical, the concept may be applied quite differently, in which cases Deshpande examines by considering the historical relationships among the various systems.

"title : Swallows and Settlers - author : Thomas R. Gottschangcategory : anthropologydescription : Between the 1890s and the Second World War, twenty-five million people traveled from the densely populated North China provinces of Shandong and Hebei to seek employment in the growing economy of China's three northeastern provinces, the area known as Manchuria. This was the greatest population movement in modern Chinese history and ranks among the largest migrations in the world.  Swallows and Settlers is the first comprehensive study of that migration. Drawing methods from their respective fields of economics and history, the coauthors focus on both the broad quantitative outlines of the movement and on the decisions and experiences of individual migrants and their families. In readable narrative prose, the book lays out the historical relationship between North China and the Northeast (Manchuria) and concludes with an examination of ongoing population movement between these regions since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.

"title : Chinese Communist Materials at the Bureau of Investigation Archives, Taiwan - author : Peter Donovancategory : anthropologydescription : During the long years of civil strife in China the Nationalist authorities amassed extensive materials on their Communist adversaries. Now stored in government institutions on Taiwan, these materials are an excellent source for the study of the Chinese Communist movement. Among them is the Bureau of Investigation Collection (BIC), which holds over 300,000 volumes of primary documents on the Chinese Communist movement.  The purpose of Chinese Communist Materials is, without any attempt at comprehensive listing of the Bureau’s holdings, to give scholars a representative description of the collection, to point out its implications for research, and suggest new areas for research at the Bureau in the fields of political science and history [1, 4].

"title : The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia - author : James C. Scottcategory : anthropologydescription : James Scott, recognized worldwide as an eminent authority in Southeast Asian, peasant, and agrarian studies, tells the story of the peoples of Zomia and their unlikely odyssey in search of self-determination. He redefines our views on Asian politics, history, demographics, and even our fundamental ideas about what constitutes civilization, and challenges us with a radically different approach to history that presents events from the perspective of stateless peoples and redefines state-making as a form of “internal colonialism.” This new perspective requires a radical reevaluation of the civilizational narratives of the lowland states.  Scott’s work on Zomia represents a new way to think of area studies that will be applicable to other runaway, fugitive, and marooned communities, be they Gypsies, Cossacks, tribes fleeing slave raiders, Marsh Arabs, or San-Bushmen.

"title : Plato's Fable - author : Joshua Mitchellcategory : anthropologydescription : This book is an exploration of Plato's Republic that bypasses arcane scholarly debates. Plato's Fable provides refreshing insight into what, in Plato's view, is the central problem of life: the mortal propensity to adopt defective ways of answering the question of how to live well.  How, in light of these tendencies, can humankind be saved? Joshua Mitchell discusses the question in unprecedented depth by examining one of the great books of Western civilization.  He draws us beyond the ancients/moderns debate, and beyond the notion that Plato's Republic is best understood as shedding light on the promise of discursive democracy. Instead, Mitchell argues, the question that ought to preoccupy us today is neither ""reason"" nor ""discourse,"" but rather ""imitation."" To what extent is man first and foremost an ""imitative"" being? This, Mitchell asserts, is the subtext of the great political and foreign policy debates of our times.  Plato's Fable is not simply a work of textual exegesis. It is an attempt to move debates within political theory beyond their current location. Mitchell recovers insights about the depth of the problem of mortal imitation from Plato's magnificent work, and seeks to explicate the meaning of Plato's central claim--that ""only philosophy can save us.""

"title : Cultivating political and public identity - author : Rodney Barkercategory : anthropologydescription : ""Throughout the twentieth century, everyone from Marxists to economic individualists assumed that social and political activity was driven by the rational pursuit of material gain. Today, the fundamental importance of the cultivation and preservation of identity is finally re-emerging. In this book, Rodney Barker explores the rich fabric of speech, dress, diet and the built environment from which human identity is made. The colour of a scarf or the accent of a conversation can unite people or divide them, and the smallest detail can play its part in signalling who are allies and who are enemies. Identity simultaneously generates equality and inequality – it is both the engine of public life and the cause of its confusion and conflict – and a better understanding of its subtleties is crucial if we are to confront the tensions that it produces in society.  Synthesising methods and ideas from numerous disciplines – including history, political science, anthropology, law and sociology – Barker presents a picture of human life as more than just a collection of material interests. His ultimate aim is to show that no human activity is trivial or meaningless, that everything counts and plumage matters.""   Read more Read less"
"title : White backlash and the politics of multiculturalism - author : Roger Hewittcategory : anthropologydescription : The murder of Stephen Lawrence led to the widest review of institutional racism seen in the UK. Sections of the white working-class communities in south London near to the scene of the murder, however, displayed deep hostility to the equalities and multiculturalist practice of the local state and other agencies. Drawing on extensive ethnographic research, this book relates these phenomena to the 'backlash' to multiculturalism evident during the 1990s in the USA, Australia, Canada, the UK and other European countries. It examines these within the unfolding social and political responses to race equalities in the UK and the USA from the 1960s to the present in the context of changes in social class and national political agendas. This book is unique in linking a detailed study of a community at a time of its critical importance to national debates over racism and multiculturalism, to historically wider international economic and social trends.

"title : Enter Culture, Exit Arts? - author : Semi Purhonencategory : anthropologydescription : Key debates of contemporary cultural sociology – the rise of the ‘cultural omnivore’, the fate of classical ‘highbrow’ culture, the popularization, commercialization and globalization of culture – deal with temporal changes. Yet, systematic research about these processes is scarce due to the lack of suitable longitudinal data. This book explores these questions through the lens of a crucial institution of cultural mediation – the culture sections in quality European newspapers – from 1960 to 2010. Starting from the framework of cultural stratification and employing systematic content analysis both quantitative and qualitative of more than 13,000 newspaper articles, Enter Culture, Exit Arts? presents a synthetic yet empirically rich and detailed account of cultural transformation in Europe over the last five decades. It shows how classifications and hierarchies of culture have changed in course of the process towards increased cultural heterogeneity. Furthermore, it conceptualizes the key trends of rising popular culture and declining highbrow arts as two simultaneous processes: the one of legitimization of popular culture and the other of popularization of traditional legitimate culture, both important for the loosening of the boundary between ‘highbrow’ and ‘popular’. Through careful comparative analysis and illustrative snapshots into the specific socio-historical contexts in which the newspapers and their representations of culture are embedded – in Finland, France, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the UK – the book reveals the key patterns and diversity of European variations in the transformation of cultural hierarchies since the 1960s. The book is a collective endeavour of a large-scale international research project active between 2013 and 2018.   Read more Read less"

"title : Social Media in Southeast Turkey - author : Elisabetta Costacategory : anthropologydescription : This book presents an ethnographic study of social media in Mardin, a medium-sized town located in the Kurdish region of Turkey. The town is inhabited mainly by Sunni Muslim Arabs and Kurds, and has been transformed in recent years by urbanisation, neoliberalism and political events. Elisabetta Costa uses her 15 months of ethnographic research to explain why public-facing social media is more conservative than offline life. Yet, at the same time, social media has opened up unprecedented possibilities for private communications between genders and in relationships among young people ? Costa reveals new worlds of intimacy, love and romance. She also discovers that, when viewed from the perspective of people?s everyday lives, political participation on social media looks very different to how it is portrayed in studies of political postings separated from their original complex, and highly socialised, context.

"title : The Navajos - author : Underhill, Ruth Murraycategory : anthropologydescription : In this volume Ruth Underhill presents the absorbing and authoritative account of the Navajos, from the time of their myth-shrouded appearance in the Southwest to their present-day position as America's largest Indian tribe, with a population of 100,000 occupying a reservation of fifteen million acres.  The Navajos, blood relations of the Apaches, once virtually ruled the area now known as Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, which they robbed with impunity. Unable to tolerate their depredations any longer, Anglo-Americans, Mexicans, and other Indians rose up in protest, demanding the subjugation of the Navajos, who were accused of every crime and held responsible for almost every Indian attack in the area. The job was given to Colonel Kit Carson, who defeated the Navajos in 1864 and moved them to a small reservation at Fort Sumner, where they remained for nearly four years before being returned to their original home.  It was upon their agriculture, sheepherding, and artistry in blanket weaving and silversmithing that the Navajos, now unable to continue their profitable raiding, became dependent during the early, trying days of reservation life. Miss Underhill's careful examination of the complex mythical aura that surrounds the early Navajos offers an interesting insight into their colorful history and rich cultural background, but it is her sensitive portrayal of their adjustment to a new way of life that distinguishes her account of this great tribe.

Today, the group provides crucial evidence for international courts and works with a wide range of activist groups, NGOs, Amnesty International, and the UN. Forensic Architecture has not only shed new light on human rights violations and state crimes across the globe, but has also created a new form of investigative practice that bears its name. The group uses architecture as an optical device to investigate armed conflicts and environmental destruction, as well as to cross-reference a variety of evidence sources, such as new media, remote sensing, material analysis, witness testimony, and crowd-sourcing. In Forensic Architecture, Eyal Weizman, the group's founder, provides, for the first time, an in-depth introduction to the history, practice, assumptions, potentials, and double binds of this practice. The book includes an extensive array of images, maps, and detailed documentation that records the intricate work the group has performed. Traversing multiple scales and durations, the case studies in this volume include the analysis of the shrapnel fragments in a room struck by drones in Pakistan, the reconstruction of a contested shooting in the West Bank, the architectural recreation of a secret Syrian detention center from the memory of its survivors, a blow-by-blow account of a day-long battle in Gaza, and an investigation of environmental violence and climate change in the Guatemalan highlands and elsewhere. Weizman's Forensic Architecture, stunning and shocking in its critical narrative, powerful images, and daring investigations, presents a new form of public truth, technologically, architecturally, and aesthetically produced. The practice calls for a transformative politics in which architecture as a field of knowledge and a mode of interpretation exposes and confronts ever-new forms of state violence and secrecy --   Read more Read less"

"title : The possessive investment in whiteness - author : George Lipsitzcategory : anthropologydescription : In this unflinching look at white supremacy, George Lipsitz argues that racism is a matter of interests as well as attitudes, a problem of property as well as pigment. Above and beyond personal prejudice, whiteness is a structured advantage that produces unfair gains and unearned rewards for whites while imposing impediments to asset accumulation, employment, housing, and health care for minorities. Reaching beyond the black/white binary, Lipsitz shows how whiteness works in respect to Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans.Lipsitz delineates the weaknesses embedded in civil rights laws, the racial dimensions of economic restructuring and deindustrialization, and the effects of environmental racism, job discrimination and school segregation. He also analyzes the centrality of whiteness to U.S. culture, and perhaps most importantly, he identifies the sustained and perceptive critique of white privilege embedded in the radical black tradition. This revised and expanded edition also includes an essay about the impact of Hurricane Katrina on working class Blacks in New Orleans, whose perpetual struggle for dignity and self determination has been obscured by the city's image as a tourist party town.

"title : Performing Objects and Theatrical Things - author : Marlis Schweitzercategory : anthropologydescription : ""Performing Objects and Theatrical Things rethinks historical and contemporary theatre, performance, and cultural events from the perspective of the objects and things that activate stages, venues, environments, and archives. Embracing methodologies from across the humanities and social sciences, we understand physical materials as actants, with particular frequencies, energies, and potentials to affect human and nonhuman worlds. The texts, stage properties, instruments, costumes, photographs, and detritus that animate this collection emerge from the thirteenth- to the twenty-first century, traversing sites across Europe and North America. Challenging anthropocentric narratives that foreground humans as sole agents, our authors present object and 'thingcentric' methodologies that range from deeply personal autoethnographic reflections and close textual readings to carefully researched archival studies and rhizomatic explorations of an object's journey from one place and time to another""--   Read more Read less"

In this landmark book, Ronald Hutton traces witchcraft from the ancient world to the early-modern stake. This book sets the notorious European witch trials in the widest and deepest possible perspective and traces the major historiographical developments of witchcraft. Hutton, a renowned expert on ancient, medieval, and modern paganism and witchcraft beliefs, combines Anglo-American and continental scholarly approaches to examine attitudes on witchcraft and the treatment of suspected witches across the world, including in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, Australia, and North and South America, and from ancient pagan times to current interpretations. His fresh anthropological and ethnographical approach focuses on cultural inheritance and change while considering shamanism, folk religion, the range of witch trials, and how the fear of witchcraft might be eradicated""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Mobilities, Boundaries, and Travelling Ideas - author : Manja Stephan-Emmrichcategory : anthropologydescription : ""This collection brings together a variety of anthropological, historical and sociological case studies from Central Asia and the Caucasus to examine the concept of translocality. The chapters scrutinize the capacity of translocality to describe, in new ways, the multiple mobilities, exchange practices and globalizing processes that link places, people and institutions in Central Asia and the Caucasus with others in Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates. Illuminating translocality as a productive concept for studying cross‐regional connectivities and networks, this volume is an important contribution to a lively field of academic discourse. Following new directions in Area Studies, the chapters aim to overcome ‘territorial containers’ such as the nation‐state or local community, and instead emphasize the significance of processes of translation and negotiation for understanding how meaningful localities emerge beyond conventional boundaries.    Structured by the four themes ‘crossing boundaries’, ‘travelling ideas’, ‘social and economic movements’ and ‘pious endeavours’, this volume proposes three conceptual approaches to translocality: firstly, to trace how it is embodied, narrated, virtualized or institutionalized within or in reference to physical or imagined localities; secondly, to understand locality as a relational concept rather than a geographically bounded unit; and thirdly, to consider cross‐border traders, travelling students, business people and refugees as examples of non-elite mobilities that provide alternative ways to think about what ‘global’ means today.    Mobilities, Boundaries, and Travelling Ideas will be of interest to students and scholars of the anthropology, history and sociology of Central Asia and the Caucasus, as well as for those interested in new approaches to Area Studies.""

"title : Margaret Mead and Samoa - author : Derek Freemancategory : anthropologydescription : “In 1928 Margaret Mead announced her stunning discovery of a culture in which the storm and stress of adolescence do not exist. COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA has since become a classic - and the bestselling anthropology book of all time. Within me nature-nurture controversy that still divides scientists, Mead’s evidence has long been a crucial “negative instance,” an apparent proof of the sovereignty of culture over biology.    In MARGARET MEAD AND SAMOA, Professor Freeman presents startling but wholly convincing evidence that Mead’s proof is false. On the basis of years of patient fieldwork and historical research, Freeman refutes Mead’s characterization on of Samoan society and adolescence point for point. Far from the relaxed transition to adulthood that Mead ascribed to permissive childrearing and tolerant sexual attitudes, Samoan adolescence, Freeman demonstrates, is a time of frequent stress in an authoritarian society with punitive methods of childrearing and restrictive regulations against premarital sex. Freeman’s book thus corrects a towering scientific error. His aim is not to blame Margaret Mead but to understand how her error could have occurred and become basic to the doctrine of cultural determinism. The result is a detective story in the history of science, one filled with engrossing details about cultural anthropology’s battle with the eugenics movement, about Mead’s relationships with her most important colleagues, Ruth Benedict and Franz Boas, and finally about her poor preparation for the field and the likelihood that she was duped by her adolescent informants. Beyond these particulars lie painful but important generalizations about how the truth in science can sometimes be obscured by theory and how theory can sometimes be twisted by ideology.” BOOK JACKET.

"title : Media and the rhetoric of body perfection - author : Deborah Harris-Moorecategory : anthropologydescription : Against the background of the so-called 'obesity epidemic', Media and the Rhetoric of Body Perfection critically examines the discourses of physical perfection that pervade Western societies, shedding new light on the rhetorical forces behind body anxieties and extreme methods of weight loss and beautification. Drawing on rich interview material with cosmetic surgery patients and offering fresh analyses of various texts from popular culture, including internationally-screened reality-television shows including The Biggest Loser, Extreme Makeover and The Swan as well as entertainment programmes and documentaries, this book examines the ways in which Western media capitalise on body anxiety by presenting physical perfection as a moral imperative, whilst advertising quick and effective transformation methods to erase physical imperfections. With attention to contemporary lines of resistance to standards of thinness and attempts to redefine conceptions of beauty, Media and the Rhetoric of Body Perfection will appeal to scholars and students of popular culture, television, media and cultural studies, as well as the sociology of the body, feminist thought, body transformation and cosmetic surgery.

"title : Public justice and the anthropology of law - author : Ronald Niezencategory : anthropologydescription : ""In this powerful, timely study Ronald Niezen examines the processes by which cultural concepts are conceived and collective rights are defended in international law. Niezen argues that cultivating support on behalf of those experiencing human rights violations often calls for strategic representations of injustice and suffering to distant audiences. The positive impulse behind public responses to political abuse can be found in the satisfaction of justice done. But the fact that oppressed peoples and their supporters from around the world are competing for public attention is actually a profound source of global difference, stemming from differential capacities to appeal to a remote, unknown public. Niezen's discussion of the impact of public opinion on law provides fresh insights into the importance of legally-constructed identity and the changing pathways through which it is being shaped - crucial issues for all those with an interest in anthropology, politics and human rights law""--   Read more Read less"

"title : How to Read a Folktale - author : Lee Haringcategory : anthropologydescription : How to Read a Folktale offers the first English translation of Ibonia, a spellbinding tale of old Madagascar. Ibonia is a folktale on epic scale. Much of its plot sounds familiar: a powerful royal hero attempts to rescue his betrothed from an evil adversary and, after a series of tests and duels, he and his lover are joyfully united with a marriage that affirms the royal lineage. These fairytale elements link Ibonia with European folktales, but the tale is still very much a product of Madagascar. It contains African-style praise poetry for the hero; it presents Indonesian-style riddles and poems; and it inflates the form of folktale into epic proportions. Recorded when the Malagasy people were experiencing European contact for the first time, Ibonia proclaims the power of the ancestors against the foreigner. Through Ibonia, Lee Haring expertly helps readers to understand the very nature of folktales. His definitive translation, originally published in 1994, has now been fully revised to emphasize its poetic qualities, while his new introduction and detailed notes give insight into the fascinating imagination and symbols of the Malagasy. Haring’s research connects this exotic narrative with fundamental questions not only of anthropology but also of literary criticism.   Read more Read less"

"title : Adam and the family of man - author : J. de Frainecategory : anthropologydescription : Many ideas which are basic in Semitic thought and essential to a proper understanding of the Bible are, unfortunately, alien to our way of thinking. The Biblical notion of the corporate personality is a fundamental theme in the Scriptures ... and this pioneering study of that basic idea is an important event for Biblical students and all who work toward the creation of a truly Catholic and Scriptural theology. This work carefully and clearly uncovers the meaning, nuances and implications of the concept of corporate personality as seen in the Bible. This enables us to move to a fuller appreciation of the involvement of the human race in Adam and original sin; and it richly elucidates our unity in the redeeming Christ. It is a key theological concept and offers a basis for insight into many revitalized themes in modern theology--sin and redemption; grace; the Church as the extension of Christ; Mary, the image of the Church.

In einem ausführlichen Vorwort zur dritten Auflage wird die prinzipielle Gültigkeit der Analysen der social anthropology nachgewiesen.

"title : Fragile Conviction - author : Mathijs Pelkmanscategory : anthropologydescription : How does ideology function during periods of political and economic turmoil? This book, based on long-term ethnographic research in a destitute former mining town in Kyrgyzstan, testifies to the precariousness of life in the former Soviet republics in the decades after the collapse of the USSR. It follows inhabitants as they make sense of a radically changing world and as they try to imbue their lives with relevance and direction, while concentrating in depth on their engagement with a range of religious ideas and other ideological currents, including scientific atheism, evangelical Christianity, Sunni Islamic revivalism, and traditional shamanistic beliefs. By examining such a broad variety of belief systems and how they manifest themselves in daily life, the author provides new insights into how ideology works (or fails to work) and how cultural and religious convictions are collectively produced and shaped.

"title : Life Histories of Etnos Theory in Russia and Beyond - author : Anderson, David G.category : anthropologydescription : The idea of etnos came into being over a hundred years ago as a way of understanding the collective identities of people with a common language and shared traditions. In the twentieth century, the concept came to be associated with Soviet state-building, and it fell sharply out of favour. Yet outside the academy, etnos-style arguments not only persist, but are a vibrant part of regional anthropological traditions. Life Histories of Etnos Theory in Russia and Beyond makes a powerful argument for reconsidering the importance of etnos in our understanding of ethnicity and national identity across Eurasia. The collection brings to life a rich archive of previously unpublished letters, fieldnotes, and photographic collections of the theory’s early proponents. Using contemporary fieldwork and case studies, the volume shows how the ideas of these ethnographers continue to impact and shape identities in various regional theatres from Ukraine to the Russian North to the Manchurian steppes of what is now China. Through writing a life history of these collectivist concepts, the contributors to this volume unveil a world where the assumptions of liberal individualism do not hold. In doing so, they demonstrate how notions of belonging are not fleeting but persistent, multi-generational, and bio-social.   Read more Read less"

The first was originally written as a biographical contribution to a sociological reference work. Though commissioned by the editors, it was rejected after Becker submitted it. The second essay was delivered at a professional meeting of anthropologists. The significance of these essays, and especially Becker’s decision to publish them under the title, The Lost Science of Man, is that they signal Becker’s awareness and acceptance of the fact that his hoped for program of a unified moral and social science would not be accepted in his lifetime. These essays track Becker’s attempts to understand this rejection based on the histories of academic sociology and anthropology. [Ernest Becker Foundation]   Read more Read less"

"title : Ancient traditions - author : Jane Stevenson Daycategory : anthropologydescription : Shamanism is the world's oldest religion. The rituals and beliefs of this ancient tradition were carried from Asia and Siberia into the New World by nomadic hunting bands beginning 12,000 years ago. This unique collection of essays on shamanism in Central Asia and the Indian Americas provides sound and engaging scholarship that reflects the great diversity in this fascinating field. Over the centuries, shamanism has endured as an abiding topic of interest not only because of a human concern with the past, but also because of a common yearning to acknowledge life lived in closer symbolic relationship to earth cycles. For the reader interested in indigenous cultures and religions, this collection of essays clarifies much of the New Age speculation on universals in shamanism by bringing studies of different ethnic and historical expressions to bear on the subject.

It is argued that these categories are most fruitfully understood not as static and mutually exclusive positions within the debate around witchcraft, but as rhetorical tools usedThis book illuminates the personal experience of being at the centre of a media scandal. The existential level of that experience is highlighted by means of the application of ethnological and phenomenological perspectives to extensive empirical material drawn from a Swedish context. The questions raised and answered in this book include the following: How does the experience of being the protagonist in a media scandal affect a person?s everyday life? What happens to routines, trust, and self-confidence? How does it change the basic settings of his or her lifeworld?The analysis also contributes new perspectives on the fusion between interpersonal communication that takes place face to face, such as gossip and rumours, and traditional news media in the course of a scandal. A scandal derives its momentum from the audiences, whose engagement in the moral story determines its dissemination and duration. The nature of that engagement also affects the protagonist in specific ways. Members of the public participate through traditional oral communication, one vital aspect of which is activity in digital, social forums. The author argues that gossip and rumour must be included in the idea of the media system if we are to be able to understand the formation and power of a media scandal, a contention which entails critiques of earlier research. Oral interpersonal communication does not disappear when new communication possibilities arise. Indeed, it may be invigorated by them. The term news legend is introduced, to capture the entanglement between traditional news-media storytelling and oral narrative.   Read more Read less"

"title : Temas y problemas en Antropología Social - author : Roberto Ringueletcategory : anthropologydescription : El presente texto tiene que ver con el programa de la materia Antropología Cultural y Social dictada en la Facultad de Psicología de nuestra Universidad de La Plata. Sus diversos capítulos cubren varios temas del curso y fueron antecedidos por otros textos temáticos menos formalizados, editados anteriormente por la Cátedra.  Nos ha parecido siempre importante adaptar los conocimientos de la Antropología en el marco de las Ciencias Sociales y de la Antropología Social en particular -que constituyen el eje de la materia- con la intención de conformar un eje didáctico de materiales que sean de fácil comprensión y permitan una lectura ulterior de mayor profundidad y continuidad, según el avance en la construcción de los conocimientos por parte de alumnos. Esto es importante por cuanto la disciplina constituye, de acuerdo al nuevo perfil del Plan de Estudios, uno de los cuatro pilares de conocimiento básico de la Psicología.  En este sentido, se la considera un ámbito disciplinar académico destacado que aporta a los estudiantes herramientas conceptual-metodológicas básicas para la lectura y comprensión crítica del contexto sociohistórico, cultural y político en el que desarrollan sus prácticas actuales y su futura práctica profesional. Con una perspectiva más amplia se ha pensado, al redactar los capítulos, en el posible interés que puedan tener su lectura en el ámbito general de la Universidad.   Read more Read less"

"title : Ethnicity - author : George Paul Meiucategory : anthropologydescription : In the economics of everyday life, even ethnicity has become a potential resource to be tapped, generating new sources of profit and power, new ways of being social, and new visions of the future. Throughout Africa, ethnic corporations have been repurposed to do business in mining or tourism; in the USA, Native American groupings have expanded their involvement in gaming, design, and other industries; and all over the world, the commodification of culture has sown itself deeply into the domains of everything from medicine to fashion.  Ethnic groups increasingly seek empowerment by formally incorporating themselves, by deploying their sovereign status for material ends, and by copyrighting their cultural practices as intellectual property. Building on ethnographic case studies from Kenya, Nepal, Peru, Russia, and many other countries, this collection poses the question: Does the turn to the incorporation and commodification of ethnicity really herald a new historical moment in the global politics of identity?

"title : Gender, Generations and the Family in International Migration - author : Albert Kralercategory : anthropologydescription : Family-related migration is moving to the centre of political debates on migration, integration and multiculturalism in Europe. It is also more and more leading to lively academic interest in the family dimensions of international migration. At the same time, strands of research on family migrations and migrant families remain separate from - and sometimes ignorant of - each other. This volume seeks to bridge the disciplinary divides. Fifteen chapters come up with a number of common themes. Collectively, the authors address the need to better understand the diversity of family-related migration and its resulting family forms and practices, to question, if not counter, simplistic assumptions about migrant families in public discourses, to study family migration from a mix of disciplinary perspectives at various levels and via different methodological approaches and to acknowledge the state's role in shaping family-related migration, practices and lives.

"title : A Risky Business? - author : Marta Kindlercategory : anthropologydescription : This book is about migration as a form of risk-taking. Based on Ukrainian women's experiences in the Polish domestic work sector, it presents a new approach to analyse movements of female migrants responding to the demand for household labour around the world. Risks involved in migration and in migrant domestic work are accounted for in detail alongside an analysis of the migration decision-making processes. This study shows how social ties and migrant institutions effectively reduce the otherwise radical asymmetry of power between an individual migrant, the state and an employer. A Risky Business? brings to light the complex risk structures of migrants' activities and their sophisticated responses to them. With their innovative strategies, migrants challenge government-imposed constraints and thus reduce the risks of migration.   Read more Read less"

"title : Caribbean Pleasure Industry: Tourism, Sexuality, and AIDS in the Dominican Republic - author : Mark Padillacategory : anthropologydescription : In recent years, the economy of the Caribbean has become almost completely dependent on international tourism. And today one of the chief ways that foreign visitors there seek pleasure is through prostitution. While much has been written on the female sex workers who service these tourists, Caribbean Pleasure Industry shifts the focus onto the men. Drawing on his groundbreaking ethnographic research in the Dominican Republic, Mark Padilla discovers a complex world where the global political and economic impact of tourism has led to shifting sexual identities, growing economic pressures, and new challenges for HIV prevention.  In fluid prose, Padilla analyzes men who have sex with male tourists, yet identify themselves as ""normal"" heterosexual men and struggle to maintain this status within their relationships with wives and girlfriends. Padilla’s exceptional ability to describe the experiences of these men will interest anthropologists, but his examination of bisexuality and tourism as much-neglected factors in the HIV/AIDS epidemic makes this book essential to anyone concerned with health and sexuality in the Caribbean or beyond.

"title : The Fifth World of Forster Bennett: Portrait of a Navajo - author : Vincent Crapanzanocategory : anthropologydescription : It is told that the ancestors of the Navajos journeyed through four worlds to reach the fifth, or present, one. The pressing complexities and underlying wonder of their fifth world of modern reservation life are portrayed in this classic ethnographic account by Vincent Crapanzano.  As a young, inexperienced anthropologist, Crapanzano spent a summer with a Navajo man he calls Forster Bennett. In his fifties, Bennett was raised during the early reservation years, fought in the South Pacific in the Second World War, and, like many, carried a deep but not always openly expressed resentment toward whites. Crapanzano’s honest and gritty account of his time with Bennett and Bennett's community reveals a stark portrait of the “flat, slow quality of reservation life,” where boredom and poverty coexist with age-old sacred rituals and the varying ways that Navajos react and adjust to changes in their culture.

"title : Water Societies and Technologies from the Past and Present - author : Mark Altaweelcategory : anthropologydescription : Today our societies face great challenges with water, in terms of both quantity and quality, but many of these challenges have already existed in the past. Focusing on Asia, Water Societies and Technologies from the Past and Present seeks to highlight the issues that emerge or re-emerge across different societies and periods, and asks what they can tell us about water sustainability. Incorporating cutting-edge research and pioneering field surveys on past and present water management practices, the interdisciplinary contributors together identify how societies managed water resource challenges and utilised water in ways that allowed them to evolve, persist, or drastically alter their environment.    The case studies, from different periods, ancient and modern, and from different regions, including Egypt,  Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Southwest United States, the Indus Basin, the Yangtze River, the Mesopotamian floodplain, the early Islamic city of Sultan Kala in Turkmenistan, and ancient Korea, offer crucial empirical data to readers interested in comparing the dynamics of water management practices across time and space, and to those who wish to understand water-related issues through conceptual and quantitative models of water use. The case studies also challenge classical theories on water management and social evolution, examine and establish the deep historical roots and ecological foundations of water sustainability issues, and contribute new grounds for innovations in sustainable urban planning and ecological resilience.

"title : Social Media in Northern Chile (Free open access PDF) - author : Nell Haynescategory : anthropologydescription : Based on 15 months of ethnographic research in the city of Alto Hospicio in northern Chile, this book describes how the residents use social media, and the consequences of this use in their daily lives. Nell Haynes argues that social media is a place where Alto Hospicio’s residents – or Hospiceños – express their feelings of marginalisation that result from living in city far from the national capital, and with a notoriously low quality of life compared to other urban areas in Chile.  In actively distancing themselves from residents in cities such as Santiago, Hospiceños identify as marginalised citizens, and express a new kind of social norm. Yet Haynes finds that by contrasting their own lived experiences with those of people in metropolitan areas, Hospiceños are strengthening their own sense of community and the sense of normativity that shapes their daily lives. This exciting conclusion is illustrated by the range of social media posts about personal relationships, politics and national citizenship, particularly on Facebook.   Read more Read less"
"title : Anthropology and development - author : Emma Crewecategory : anthropologydescription : ""In recent decades international development has grown into a world-shaping industry. But how do aid agencies work and what do they achieve? How does aid appear to those who receive it? And why has there been so little improvement in the position of the poor? Viewing aid and development from anthropological perspectives gives illuminating answers to questions such as these. This essential textbook reveals anthropologists' often surprising findings and details ethnographic case studies on the cultures of development. The authors use a fertile literature to examine the socio-political organisation of aid communities, agencies and networks as well as the judgements they make about each other. Exploring the spaces between policy and practice, success and failure, the future and the past, this book provides a rounded understanding of development work that suggests new moral and political possibilities for an increasingly globalised world""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Extravíos de la antropología mexicana - author : Horst Kurnitzkycategory : anthropologydescription : This essay addresses, from a critical perspective, the main methodological problems of Mexican anthropology. Some of these problems are the incomprehension that latinization of Nahuatl brought with, the incomprehension of social relations hips inherent to a theocracy, above all, the ignoring of sacrifice as the material base of these cultures; the incapacity to interpret myths, the faulty periodization of Mesoamerican history and the positivistic interpretation of Prehispanic reality. This essay also sets out to explain how revolutionary nationalism and its corresponding exaltation of the Mexican past have contributed to aggravate the stated methodological problems.  Este ensayo aborda, desde una posición crítica, los principales problemas metodológicos de la antropología mexicana. Algunos de estos problemas son la incomprensión de las relaciones sociales propias de una teocracia, sobre todo, la ignorancia del sacrificio como base material de estas culturas, la incapacidad de interpretar los mitos, la incomprensión de las consecuencias que trajo consigo la latinización del náhuatl, la fallida periodización de la historia mesoamericana y la interpretación positivista de la realidad prehispánica. Este ensayo también plantea cómo el nacionalismo revolucionario y su correspondiente exaltación del pasado mexicano han fomentado dichos problemas metodológicos.  Ausgehend von einer kritischen Position, werden in diesem Essay grundlegende Zweifel an den Methoden der mexikanischen Anthropologie erörtert. Einige dieser Probleme sind: das Unverständnis der spezifischen Sozialverhältnisse einer Theokratie, vor allem, die Ignoranz gegenüber dem Opfer als materielle Basis dieser Kulturen, die Unfähigkeit Mythen zu interpretieren, das Unverständnis gegenüber den Konsequenzen, welche die Latinisierung des Nahuatl nach sich zieht, die fehlgeschlagene Periodisierung der mittelamerikanischen Geschichte und die positivistische Interpretation der präspanischen Realität. Der Essay zeigt auch, wie der revolutionäre Nationalismus und die damit verbundene Verherrlichung der mexikanischen Vorgeschichte diese methodologischen Irrwege begünstigt haben.

"title : Scholars at War - author : Christine Wintercategory : anthropologydescription : Scholars at War is the first scholarly publication to examine the effect World War II had on the careers of Australasian social scientists. It links a group of scholars through geography, transnational, national and personal scholarly networks, and shared intellectual traditions, explores their use, and contextualizes their experiences and contributions within wider examinations of the role of intellectuals in war. Scholars at War is structured around historical portraits of individual Australasian social scientists. They are not a tight group; rather a cohort of scholars serendipitously involved in and affected by war who share a point of origin. Analyzing practitioners of the social sciences during war brings to the fore specific networks, beliefs and institutions that transcend politically defined spaces. Individual lives help us to make sense of the historical process, helping us illuminate particular events and the larger cultural, social and even political processes of a moment in time.

"title : Raw Life, New Hope - author : Fiona Rosscategory : anthropologydescription : The Cape Flats, a windswept, barren and sandy area which rings Cape Town, is home to more than a million people. Many live here in sprawling shack settlements. The post-apartheid state is attempting to eradicate such settlements by providing formal houses in planned residential estates. Raw Life, New Hope is a longitudinal study of the residents of one such shack settlement, The Park, who moved to new, 'formal' houses in The Village, at the turn of the millennium. It introduces readers to core social science topics and modes of theorising. Over 17 years the author has traced how ordinary people attempt to live in accord with their ideals of decency under almost impossible circumstances, and the effects of material changes in their lives after 1994, including the provision of housing. Photos, maps, anecdotes, recipes and philosophical reflections on subjects that arose during conversations elicit a sense of the everyday and of how people try to solve the problems of poverty.

"title : Zwischen Liebesideal und Realismus - Theologische Anthropologie als soziale Ressource bei Reinhold Niebuhr - author : Tina Bellmanncategory : anthropologydescription : What is there left to say about the human condition after the so-called ?end of anthropology?? Never before have conceptions of what it means to be a human being been as diverse and fragmented as in the late modern age ? with severe consequences for democratic discourse and liberal, ?Western? societies as a whole. Examining the work of American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr (1892?1971), the book presents new insights into the intersection of anthropological thought and ethical orientation. Niebuhr, motivated by his perception of profound political and social crises in ?Western? societies, develops an innovative, pragmatic and ?realistic? type of theological anthropology. His anthropological approach functions as the basis of a much larger endeavor: rescuing Christianity and democracy itself. Reading Niebuhr today opens up a refreshing perspective on current debates on public theology and the so-called ?crisis of democracy?. In this context, the book argues, theological anthropology can be reclaimed as an essential social resource: It offers a comprehensive understanding of human nature both at its best and at its worst, providing the indispensable basis for the survival and vitality of democracy.

This is just one aspect of the complex relationship that exists between local economic dynamics and the illegal behavior of social actors. The relationship between social norms and legal norms, the quality and quantity of social capital, the bonds of trust between the actors and the legitimization of the state, the local power systems, the certainty of the sanctions, are other aspects that certainly contribute to create the conditions that favor illegal responses to the crisis.

"title : Strings of Connectedness. Essays in honour of Ian Keen - author : P.G. Tonercategory : anthropologydescription : For nearly four decades, Ian Keen has been an important, challenging, and engaging presence in Australian anthropology. Beginning with his PhD research in the mid-1970s and through to the present, he has been a leading scholar of Yolngu society and culture, and has made lasting contributions to a range of debates. His scholarly productivity, however, has never been limited to the Yolngu, and he has conducted research and published widely on many other facets of Australian Aboriginal society: on Aboriginal culture in ‘settled’ Australia; comparative historical work on Aboriginal societies at the threshold of colonisation; a continuing interest in kinship; ongoing writing on language and society; and a set of significant land claims across the continent. In this volume of essays in his honour, a group of Keen’s former students and current colleagues celebrate the diversity of his scholarly interests and his inspiring influence as a mentor and a friend, with contributions ranging across language structure, meaning, and use; the post-colonial engagement of Aboriginal Australians with the ideas and structures of ‘mainstream’ society; ambiguity and indeterminacy in Aboriginal symbolic systems and ritual practices; and many other interconnected themes, each of which represents a string that he has woven into the rich tapestry of his scholarly work.

"title : Sex Panic And The Punitive State - author : Roger N. Lancastercategory : anthropologydescription : One evening, while watching the news, Roger N. Lancaster was startled by a report that a friend, a gay male school teacher, had been arrested for a sexually based crime. The resulting hysteria threatened to ruin the life of an innocent man. In this passionate and provocative book, Lancaster blends astute analysis, robust polemic, ethnography, and personal narrative to delve into the complicated relationship between sexuality and punishment in our society. Drawing on classical social science, critical legal studies, and queer theory, he tracks the rise of a modern suburban culture of fear and develops new insights into the punitive logic that has put down deep roots in everyday American life.

"title : THE INFORMATIVE PROCESS IN THE CLINICAL SETTING (MEDICAL UNCERTAINTY, CULTURES, PHYSICIANS, NURSES, PATIENTS) - author : Joan Jensen Mathewscategory : anthropologydescription : The purpose of this study is to describe and analyze the information sharing process in a hospital setting, specifically as it occurs between doctors and patients, nurses and patients and doctors and nurses. This descriptive study is based on a year long period of observation and interviewing in a teaching hospital. The patient population was selected to represent the general patients population, that is, patients with medical and surgical problems which coincide with normal disease distributions in the United States.  The study is written from the perspectives of patients, physicians and nurses concerning their needs and desires for information and their problems with gaining and giving information from and to other parties.  The data indicate that physicians and nurses believe the patient has a right to information in order to participate in clinical decisions and that they attempt to inform in conceptually and linguistically appropriate ways. Many patients view information as a consumer's right and they actively engage in seeking information. However, there are various constraints on the informing process and these are discussed from the perspective of the patient, the physician and the nurse. For instance some patients insist that they do not want to be informed and nurses are constrained by ambiguous role boundaries which obscure their informing prerogatives. Although patients expressed general satisfaction with the information they receive, analysis their expressed information desires and of what they are told suggests that hospitalization is not the time to inform the patient about long-term consequences of his illness on his lifestyle.  The study also focuses on structural and cultural factors in organizations which shape the informative process. Importantly, the study provides an analysis of medical uncertainty and shows how this shapes the timing and content of information that is given by clinicans to patients.

"title : EXPERTISE, FORMALISM, AND CHANGE IN AMERICAN NURSING PRACTICE: A CASE STUDY (PROFESSIONALISM, KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE, HOSPITAL, TURNOVER) - author : Deborah Ruth Gordoncategory : anthropologydescription : This study explores nursing's changing definitions of ideal nursing expertise and practice. It is based on a two-year case study of registered nurses on two adjacent general surgical units in a teaching hospital of a metropolitan city in the United States. Several things stood out on these units. First was the high rate of turnover among nurses. This resulted in a relatively inexperienced nursing staff, with which the units seemed to be actively and effectively coping. Second, one found a strong and explicit commitment to practicing ""professional nursing,"" epitomized by nurses taking nursing histories, writing care plans, teaching patients, doing discharge planning, problem-solving for both ""psycho-social"" and physical problems, thinking and acting independently, and evaluating each other in peer review. Emphasis was on implementing a ""scientific"" approach to nursing practice, i.e., one that was systematic and rational, and on theoretical in addition to practical knowledge. Historical exploration revealed that these practices and vision of ""professional nursing"" had been recently implemented in this hospital, beginning in the 1970s in what I am calling here ""The Clinical Program."".  The third notable thing on these units was the prominence of formalism and formal models (formal models as explicit, written statements composed of elements that have been selected out of a larger context and reordered into a new whole), used both in patient care and in teaching and evaluating nurses.  This study explores the relationship between these three findings. It analyzes the strong emphasis on science and formalism: (a) in terms of nursing's bid for legitimacy, improved patient care, and liberation from medicine and its own traditional roles; and (b) in terms of change and inexperience, drawing on the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition and Benner's application of it to nursing. For one found a mutual reinforcement between the inexperience of the profession in institutionalizing professional behaviors and the inexperience of the individual nurses who arrived on the units with minimal practical experience. This two-fold inexperience, resulting in an absence of a background of shared, implicit culture, partially explains the strong reliance on formalism. Formal models and practices provide an explicit foreground which compensates for the lack of practical knowledge, cultural consensus, and dense intersubjective understanding.   Read more Read less"

"title : La muerte: el hombre ante su mayor enigma - author : Gerardo Wehingercategory : anthropologydescription : La pregunta por la muerte conduce necesariamente a una reflexión sobre el sentido de la vida. Es el significado de la vida lo que determina finalmente el sentido mismo de la muerte.  En el núcleo de este trabajo, la muerte es vista como problema existencial y está encarada fundamentalmente desde su carácter antropológico. Es, en definitiva, el hombre, ese singular existente, quien muere; y dependerá de su postura existencial ante la muerte el ""cómo"" muera, es decir, la particular forma en que ""viva"" la idea de la propia muerte.  Obviamente, no hay respuesta unívoca a la pregunta por la muerte, y yerran aquéllos que la exigen. Como la vida y el hombre mismo, la muerte será por siempre un gran enigma. Frente a su carácter inevitablemente insondable, resistente a los mejores esfuerzos intelectuales, qué otra cosa nos queda a los hombres, trágicos mortales, más que intentar vivir la vida en cada instante de la existencia y así aceptarla en su misterio.

"title : Queer brown voices - author : Uriel Quesadacategory : anthropologydescription : ""In the last three decades of the twentieth century, LGBT Latinas/os faced several forms of discrimination. The greater Latino community did not often accept sexual minorities, and the mainstream LGBT movement expected everyone, regardless of their ethnic and racial background, to adhere to a specific set of priorities so as to accommodate a “unified” agenda. To disrupt the cycle of sexism, racism, and homophobia that they experienced, LGBT Latinas/os organized themselves on local, state, and national levels, forming communities in which they could fight for equal rights while simultaneously staying true to both their ethnic and sexual identities. Yet histories of LGBT activism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s often reduce the role that Latinas/os played, resulting in misinformation, or ignore their work entirely, erasing them from history. Queer Brown Voices is the first book published to counter this trend, documenting the efforts of some of these LGBT Latina/o activists. Comprising essays and oral history interviews that present the experiences of fourteen activists across the United States and in Puerto Rico, the book offers a new perspective on the history of LGBT mobilization and activism. The activists discuss subjects that shed light not only on the organizations they helped to create and operate, but also on their broad-ranging experiences of being racialized and discriminated against, fighting for access to health care during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and struggling for awareness.""--Page 4 of cover.

"title : The second birth - author : Tilo Schabertcategory : anthropologydescription : ""This book inquires anew into the question: whence originates the political Gestalt of human life and what does it entail? In pursuit of this question the book attempts to undertake a transcultural and transhistorical grounding of political theory. The material for it has accordingly been taken from classical works of different cultural spheres. Ancient Greek, Jewish and Christian, Chinese, Arabic, ancient Egyptian, and Indian texts have been examined with regard to their fundamental claims. Analysis of these texts showed that the visions of the political existence of human begins that they entertain can be surprisingly similar ... In this way, a body of knowledge that had largely fallen into oblivion owing to the advent of modernity could be recovered and made available for contemporary political theory. It is precisely this knowledge that has the potential for providing the foundation for transcultural commonalities in our own times""--Preface.   Read more Read less"
"title : Across Anthropology - author : Jonas Tiniuscategory : anthropologydescription : ""How can we rethink anthropology beyond itself? In this book, twenty-one artists, anthropologists, and curators grapple with how anthropology has been formulated, thought, and practised ‘elsewhere’ and ‘otherwise’. They do so by unfolding ethnographic case studies from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland – and through conversations that expand these geographies and genealogies of contemporary exhibition-making. This collection considers where and how anthropology is troubled, mobilised, and rendered meaningful.  Across Anthropology charts new ground by analysing the convergences of museums, curatorial practice, and Europe’s reckoning with its colonial legacies. Situated amid resurgent debates on nationalism and identity politics, this book addresses scholars and practitioners in fields spanning the arts, social sciences, humanities, and curatorial studies.

Pride Parades and LGBT Movements contributes to a better understanding of LGBT protest dynamics through a comparative study of eleven Pride parades in seven European countries?? Czech Republic, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK?? and Mexico. Peterson, Wahlström and Wennerhag uncover the dynamics producing similarities and differences between Pride parades, using unique data from surveys of Pride participants and qualitative interviews with parade organizers and key LGBT activists. In addition to outlining the histories of Pride in the respective countries, the authors explore how the different political and cultural contexts influence: Who participates, in terms of socio-demographic characteristics and political orientations; what Pride parades mean for their participants; how participants were mobilized; how Pride organizers relate to allies and what strategies they employ for their performances of Pride.        This book will be of interest to political scientists and sociologists with an interest in LGBT studies, social movements, comparative politics and political behavior and participation.

"title : Sustainable Food Systems - author : Robert Bielcategory : anthropologydescription : This book, by a leading expert in urban agriculture, offers a genuine solution to today?s global food crisis. By contributing more to feeding themselves, cities can allow breathing space for the rural sector to convert to more organic sustainable approaches. Biel?s approach connects with current debates about agroecology and food sovereignty, asks key questions, and proposes lines of future research. He suggests that today?s food insecurity ? manifested in a regime of wildly fluctuating prices ? reflects not just temporary stresses in the existing mode of production, but more profoundly the troubled process of generating a new one. He argues that the solution cannot be implemented at a merely technical or political level: the force of change can only be driven by the kind of social movements which are now daring to challenge the existing unsustainable order. Drawing on both his academic research and teaching, and 15 years? experience as a practising urban farmer, Biel brings a unique interdisciplinary approach to this key global issue, creating a dialogue between the physical and social sciences   Read more Read less"

Fearing job loss and a feeling of being left behind, one Oregon town’s working-class residents allied with religious conservatives to deny the civil liberties of queer men and women. In a book that combines strong on-the-ground research and lucid analysis with a novelist’s imaginative sympathy, Stein’s exploration of how fear and uncertainty can cause citizens to shift blame onto “strangers” provides insight into the challenges the country faces in the age of Trump.

"title : Streetwalking - author : Ana-Maurine Laracategory : anthropologydescription : Streetwalking: LGBTQ Lives and Protest in the Dominican Republic is an exploration of the ways that lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer persons exercise power in a Catholic Hispanic heteropatriarchal nation-state, namely the Dominican Republic. Lara presents the specific strategies employed by LGBTQ community leaders in the Dominican Republic in their struggle for subjectivity, recognition, and rights.  Drawing on ethnographic encounters, film and video, and interviews, LGBTQ community leaders teach readers about streetwalking, confrontación, flipping the script, cuentos, and the use of strategic universalisms in the exercise of power and agency. Rooted in Maria Lugones's theorization of streetwalker strategies and Audre Lorde's theorization of silence and action, this text re-imagines the exercise and locus of power in examples provided by the living, thriving LGBTQ community of the Dominican Republic.

"title : Identity and idolatry - author : Richard Lintscategory : anthropologydescription : ""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."" (Genesis 1:27) Genesis 1:26-27 has served as the locus of most theological anthropologies in the central Christian tradition. However, Richard Lints observes that too rarely have these verses been understood as conceptually interwoven with the whole of the prologue materials of Genesis 1. The construction of the cosmic temple strongly hints that the ""image of God"" language serves liturgical functions. Lints argues that ""idol"" language in the Bible is a conceptual inversion of the ""image"" language of Genesis 1. These constructs illuminate each other, and clarify the canon's central anthropological concerns. The question of human identity is distinct, though not separate, from the question of human nature; the latter has far too frequently been read into the biblical use of image. Lints shows how the ""narrative"" of human identity runs from creation (imago Dei) to fall (the golden calf/idol, Exodus 32) to redemption (Christ as perfect image, Colossians 1:15-20). The biblical-theological use of image/idol is a thread through the canon that highlights the movements of redemptive history. In the concluding chapters of this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume, Lints interprets the use of idolatry as it emerges in the secular prophets of the nineteenth century, and examines the recent renaissance of interest in idolatry with its conceptual power to explain the ""culture of desire."" Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles.

"title : Material Fantasies - author : Milena Veeniscategory : anthropologydescription : This study of East German fantasies of material abundance across the border, both before and after the fall of communism, shows the close and intricate relation between ideology and fantasy in upholding social life. In 1989, news broadcasts all over the world were dominated for weeks by images of East Germans crossing the Berlin Wall to West Germany. The images, representing the fall of communism and the democratic will of the people, also showed East Germans' excitement at finally being able to enter the western consumer paradise. But what exactly had they expected to find on the other side of the Wall? Why did they shed tears of joy when for the first time in their lives, they stepped inside West German shops? And why were they prepared to pay more than 10 percent of their average monthly wage for a pineapple?  - http://www.aup.nl/do.php?a=process_visitor_download&editorial_id=3477 - >Download an excerpt. Drawing on fifteen months of research in the fast-changing post-communist East Germany, Veenis unravels the perennial truths about the interrelationships of fantasies of material wealth, personal fulfillment and social cohesion. She argues persuasively that the far-fetched socialist and capitalist promises of consumption as the road to ultimate well-being, the partial realization and partial corruption thereof, the implicit social and psychological interests underlying the politicized promises in both countries form the breeding ground for the development of materialist, cargo-cult-like fantasies, in which material well-being came to be seen as the place of - fulfillment and ultimate arrival - . Material Fantasies is published in the Technology and European History series.

"title : Sexual Citizens - author : Jennifer S. Hirschcategory : anthropologydescription : A groundbreaking study that transforms how we see and address the most misunderstood problem on college campuses: widespread sexual assault.  The fear of campus sexual assault has become an inextricable part of the college experience. Research has shown that by the time they graduate, as many as one in three women and almost one in six men will have been sexually assaulted. But why is sexual assault such a common feature of college life? And what can be done to prevent it? Drawing on the Sexual Health Initiative to Foster Transformation (SHIFT) at Columbia University, the most comprehensive study of sexual assault on a campus to date, Jennifer S. Hirsch and Shamus Khan present an entirely new framework that emphasises sexual assault’s social roots—transcending current debates about consent, predators in a “hunting ground” and the dangers of hooking up.  Sexual Citizens is based on years of research interviewing and observing college life—with students of different races, genders, sexual orientations and socioeconomic backgrounds. Hirsch and Khan’s landmark study reveals the social ecosystem that makes sexual assault so predictable, explaining how physical spaces, alcohol, peer groups and cultural norms influence young people’s experiences and interpretations of both sex and sexual assault. Through the powerful concepts of “sexual projects”, “sexual citizenship” and “sexual geographies”, the authors offer a new and widely-accessible language for understanding the forces that shape young people’s sexual relationships. Empathetic, insightful and far-ranging, Sexual Citizens transforms our understanding of sexual assault and offers a roadmap for how to address it.   Read more Read less"

To Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov captured the quintessence of Russian character in all its exaltation, compassion, and profligacy.

An audacious and resilient but now little known society, it combined orthodox Christianity with paganism, classical Greek learning with Roman power, to produce a great and creative civilization which for centuries held in check the armies of Islam.Judith Herrin's concise and compelling book replaces the standard chronological approach of most histories of Byzantium. Instead, each short chapter is focused on a theme, such as a building (the great church of Hagia Sophia), a clash over religion (iconoclasm), sex and power (the role of eunuchs), an outstanding Byzantine individual (the historian Anna Komnene), a symbol of civilization (the fork), a battle for territory (the crusades). In this way she makes accessible and understandable the grand sweeps of Byzantine history, from the founding of its magnificent capital Constantinople (modern Istanbul) in 330, to its fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.

The pharaoh's army and navy managed to defeat them, but the victory so weakened Egypt that it soon slid into decline, as did most of the surrounding civilizations. After centuries of brilliance, the civilized world of the Bronze Age came to an abrupt and cataclysmic end. Kingdoms fell like dominoes over the course of just a few decades. No more Minoans or Mycenaeans. No more Trojans, Hittites, or Babylonians. The thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium B.C., which had stretched from Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, suddenly ceased to exist, along with writing systems, technology, and monumental architecture. But the Sea Peoples alone could not have caused such widespread breakdown. How did it happen?In this major new account of the causes of this ""First Dark Ages,"" Eric Cline tells the gripping story of how the end was brought about by multiple interconnected failures, ranging from invasion and revolt to earthquakes, drought, and the cutting of international trade routes. Bringing to life the vibrant multicultural world of these great civilizations, he draws a sweeping panorama of the empires and globalized peoples of the Late Bronze Age and shows that it was their very interdependence that hastened their dramatic collapse and ushered in a dark age that lasted centuries.

"title : Warfare in the classical world - author : John Gibson Warrycategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Warfare in the Classical World is an eminently readable, detailed exploration of the art of warfare in the Graeco-Roman world which traces the evolution of weapons, fortifications, and battle tactics from the Mycenean and Homeric ages (more than 1000 years B.C.) to the barbarian invasions of Rome in the fifth century A.D. In his analysis of armed conflict, John Warry presents the reasons behind the fighting--the social and political roots of each struggle and the long-range ambitions of the leaders--and draws a portrait of military culture and military life throughout the classical period.  Julius Caesar, Demetrius the Besieger, Hannibal, and Alexander the Great are only a few of the colorful, cunning, and brilliant military commanders to be encountered here in accounts of the Trojan, Persian, and Peloponnesian wars, the decline of Sparta, the rise of the Macedonian Empire, the Punic Wars, the civil wars in Rome in the first century B.C., the wars of the Triumvirate, the Imperial Roman conquests, and the rise and ultimate success of the various barbarian forces. - Publisher.

"title : Fingerprints of the gods: a quest for the beginning and the end - author : Graham Hancockcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : This book is about the beginning of the human race. How perhaps normal history has left things out, or maybe just left things unexplained. Graham Hancock explains how certain ancient structures all over the world are much older than originally thought, how civilizations who had no means of travel seemed to have communicated in some way. Hancock tries to answer questions we may have never even thought to ask. Were ancient civilizations visited by a superior race? Were these civilizations taught about technology they wouldn't have had?      Could the story of mankind be far older than we have previously believed? Using tools as varied as archaeo-astronomy, geology, and computer analysis of ancient myths, Graham Hancock presents a compelling case to suggest that it is.  “A fancy piece of historical sleuthing . . . intriguing and entertaining and sturdy enough to give a long pause for thought.”—Kirkus Reviews  In Fingerprints of the Gods, Hancock embarks on a worldwide quest to put together all the pieces of the vast and fascinating jigsaw of mankind’s hidden past. In ancient monuments as far apart as Egypt’s Great Sphinx, the strange Andean ruins of Tihuanaco, and Mexico’s awe-inspiring Temples of the Sun and Moon, he reveals not only the clear fingerprints of an as-yet-unidentified civilization of remote antiquity, but also startling evidence of its vast sophistication, technological advancement, and evolved scientific knowledge.  A record-breaking number one bestseller in Britain, Fingerprints of the Gods contains the makings of an intellectual revolution, a dramatic and irreversible change in the way that we understand our past—and so our future.  And Fingerprints of God tells us something more. As we recover the truth about prehistory, and discover the real meaning of ancient myths and monuments, it becomes apparent that a warning has been handed down to us, a warning of terrible cataclysm that afflicts the Earth in great cycles at irregular intervals of time—a cataclysm that may be about to recur.  “Readers will hugely enjoy their quest in these pages of inspired storytelling.”—The Times (UK)   Read more Read less"

"title : Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization - author : Graham Hancockcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : From Graham Hancock, bestselling author of Fingerprints of the Gods, comes a mesmerizing book that takes us on a captivating underwater voyage to find the ruins of a lost civilization that's been hidden for thousands of years beneath the world's oceans.While Graham Hancock is no stranger to stirring up heated controversy among scientific experts, his books and television documentaries have intrigued millions of people around the world and influenced many to rethink their views about the origins of human civilization. Now he returns with an explosive new work of archaeological detection. In Underworld, Hancock continues his remarkable quest underwater, where, according to almost a thousand ancient myths from every part of the globe, the ruins of a lost civilization, obliterated in a universal flood, are to be found.Guided by cutting-edge science and the latest archaeological scholarship, Hancock begins his mission to discover the truth about these myths and examines the mystery at the end of the last Ice Age. As the glaciers melted between 17,000 and 7,000 years ago, sea levels rose and more than 15 million square miles of habitable land were submerged underwater, resulting in a radical change to the Earth's shape and the conditions in which people could live. Using the latest computer techniques to map the world's changing coastlines, Hancock finds astonishing correspondences with the ancient flood myths.Filled with thrilling accounts of his own participation in dives off the coast of Japan, as well as in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and the Arabian Sea, we watch as Hancock discovers underwater ruins exactly where the myths say they should be--sunken kingdoms that archaeologists never thought existed. Fans of Hancock's previous adventures will find themselves immersed in Underworld, a provocative book that provides both compelling hard evidence for a fascinating, forgotten episode in human history and a completely new explanation for the origins of civilization as we know it.From the Hardcover edition.

Instead he contends that the globalization of today is just the latest in a series of globalizing movements in human history. Using the Uruk, Mississippian, and Wari civilizations as case studies, Jennings examines how the growth of the world,♯s̥ first great cities radically transformed their respective areas. The cities required unprecedented exchange networks, creating long-distance flows of ideas, people, and goods. These flows created cascades of interregional interaction that eroded local behavioral norms and social structures. New, hybrid cultures emerged within these globalized regions. Although these networks did not span the whole globe, people in these areas developed globalized cultures as they interacted with one another. Jennings explores how understanding globalization as a recurring event can help in the understanding of both the past and the present""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Centuries of Darkness - author : James, Petercategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : The authors of this text, originally published in England in 1991, are young scholars who present no less than a ""chronological revolution."" After tracing the development of Old World chronology, James and his colleagues review archaeological evidence and the lack of it from the Dark Age, the centuries-long period at the end of the Late Bronze Age c.1200 B.C. They include a wide geographical area--as far east as Iran and south to Nubia. Challenging the accepted Egyptian chronology, they argue for lower dates, which would instead put the end of the Late Bronze Age around 950 B.C., thus essentially eliminating the so-called Dark Age. The authors have done a masterful job of drawing together an enormous range of evidence; their conclusion is persuasive. Their challenge to Egyptian chronology cannot be ignored, and Egyptologists will have to address the flaws that they demonstrate. For students of ancient history and archaeology.

"title : Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith - author : Graham Hancockcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : A roller coaster intellectual journey through the back streets and rat runs of history to uncover the traces in architecture and monuments of a secret religion that has shaped the world.  Review    Praise for Graham Hancock:    “A reading experience of pure gold.... History buffs, Bible scholars, anyone who likes a great intellectual detective yarn will plunge into The Sign and the Seal and not come up for air until the end.”    —Seattle Times  “Provocative.”    —The Globe and Mail  “Even if you are a confirmed skeptic, Hancock should give you pause for thought.”    —Rocky Mountain News (Denver)  “An entertaining writer and an interesting cultural journalist.”    —Publishers Weekly  Goodreads Reviewer: Tony Recommends it for: Anyone interested in religious traditions & symbols    This is perhaps the most comprehensive book I have ever read on religious traditions and symbolism. More specifically, the book deals with alternative/shadow western religious followings, from the Egyptian Goddess, Isis, to Christian Gnostics to Christian Cathars of the Middle Ages to the Knights Templar who came out of Cathar traditions to Masonic Traditions in Europe and later in the United States. The book draws parallels to many religious symbols in cities across the western world, particularly obelisks in Alexandria, Egypt, Vatican City, Paris, New York and Washington, DC. No book could be a better source of information for novelist Dan Brown, and I would be surprised if he has not read or used Talisman to gather information for much of his writings.  From Publishers Weekly    This sprawling conspiracy theory traces the influence of ancient Egyptian and gnostic ideologies concerning a dualistic, Manichean cosmos prefiguring the earthly order, knowable only through secret, magical lore from medieval Catharism to the French vogue for pharaonic monuments and deities, the astrologically suggestive layouts of Paris and Washington, and the Statue of Liberty (the ""Isis of New York""). The conventional explanation for the historical recurrence of gnostic themes and Egyptian iconography—that people peruse old texts and art works and adapt their ideas and symbols to new purposes—strikes Hancock and Bauval (coauthors of Keeper of Genesis) as inadequate. They discern the millennia-long plot of a shadowy gnostic ""Organization"" working through usual suspects like the Freemasons, whose hidden hand they see influencing everything from the French Revolution to the founding of Israel. The authors draw eye-glazing webs of connections between historical coincidences—some intriguing, others tenuous and forced—to insinuate a ""not altogether impossible"" master plan. But their proposed conspiracy never gels.     Its guiding philosophies, Christian gnosticism and pagan occultism, don't really mesh, and its agenda seems no more coherent than a perennial opposition to the alleged intolerance and obscurantism of the Catholic Church. The book's crude anticlericalism and conviction that culture propagates by conspiratorial, not intellectual, processes make it a distortion of the gnostic mindset.   Read more Read less"

"title : The Atlantis blueprint: unlocking the ancient mysteries of a long-lost civilization - author : Colin Wilsoncategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : A spellbinding blend of history and science, scholarship and speculation, this landmark work presents startling new evidence that traces archaeology's most enduring mysteries back to the lost civilization of Atlantis....The Great Pyramid. Stonehenge. Machu Picchu. For centuries, these and other sacred sites have inspired wonder among those who ponder their origins. Conventional science tells us they were constructed by local peoples working with the primitive tools of a fledgling civilization. But these megaliths nonetheless continue to attract pilgrims, scholars, and adventurers drawn by the possibility that their true spiritual and technological secrets remain hidden. Who could have built these elaborate monuments? How did they do it? And what were their incomprehensible efforts and sacrifices designed to accomplish?Now comes a revolutionary theory that connects these mysteries to reveal a hidden global pattern -- the ancient work of an advanced civilization whose warnings of planetary cataclysm now reverberate across one hundred millennia. International bestselling author Colin Wilson and Canadian researcher Rand Flem-Ath join forces to share startling evidence of a fiercely intelligent society dating back as much as 100,000 years -- one that sailed the oceans of the world, building monuments to preserve and communicate its remarkable wisdom. The Atlantis Blueprint is their term for a sophisticated network of connections between these sacred sites that they trace to Atlantis: a sophisticated maritime society that charted the globe from its home base in Antarctica ... until it was obliterated by the devastating global changes it anticipated but could not escape.Here is adventure to realms beyond our imaginings ... to shifting poles, changing latitudes ... into the world of ancient mariners who recharted the globe ... to astonishing discoveries about our ancestors. Here are the great mysteries ... the incredibly complex geography of the Temple of Luxor ... the startling sophistication of Egyptian science and math ... and tantalizing similarities among the Hebrew, Greek, and Mayan alphabets to the Chinese lunar zodiac. The Atlantis Blueprint opens up a Pandora's box of ancient mysteries, lost worlds, and millennial riddles.

"title : Forbidden History - author : J.

The latest discoveries and ideas regarding such controversial topics as Atlantis, the pyramids and extraterrestial influence are explored, and many provocative questions are raised. What emerges is a very convincing argument for the existence of advanced technologies in prehistory, and the vast yet unmistakakable outline of a lost fountainhead of world culture. These alternative arguments, once marginalized are now gaining credibility and respect.    The ancient history of civilisztion (inc. Egyptology), probably needs to be re-written. Unfortunately it probably will not happen.   Read more Read less"

"title : Three stones make a wall - author : Eric H. Clinecategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : ""In 1922, Howard Carter peered into Tutankhamun's tomb for the first time, the only light coming from the candle in his outstretched hand. Urged to tell what he was seeing through the small opening he had cut in the door to the tomb, the Egyptologist famously replied, 'I see wonderful things.' Carter's fabulous discovery is just one of the many spellbinding stories told in Three Stones Make a Wall. Written by Eric Cline, an archaeologist with more than thirty seasons of excavation experience, Three Stones Make a Wall traces the history of archaeology from an amateur pursuit to the cutting-edge science it is today by taking the reader on a tour of major archaeological sites and discoveries, from Pompeii to Petra, Troy to the Terracotta Warriors, and Mycenae to Megiddo and Masada. Cline brings to life the personalities behind these digs, including Heinrich Schliemann, the former businessman who excavated Troy, and Mary Leakey, whose discoveries advanced our understanding of human origins. The discovery of the peoples and civilizations of the past is presented in vivid detail, from the Hittites and Minoans to the Inca, Aztec, and Moche. Along the way, the book addresses the questions archaeologists are asked most often: How do you know where to dig? How are excavations actually done? How do you know how old something is? Who gets to keep what is found? Taking readers from the pioneering digs of the eighteenth century to the exciting new discoveries being made today, Three Stones Make a Wall is a lively and essential introduction to the story of archaeology""--   Read more Read less"

He delineates the incompatibility between the cultural, political, and religious beliefs and practices of the two peoples and explains how Rome's interests were served by a policy of brutality against the Jews. At the same time, Christians began to distance themselves from their origins, becoming increasingly hostile toward Jews as Christian influence spread within the empire.

"title : The Greeks and the new - author : Armand D'Angourcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : ""The Greeks have long been regarded as innovators across a wide range of fields in literature, culture, philosophy, politics and science. However, little attention has been paid to how they thought and felt about novelty and innovation itself, and to relating this to the forces of traditionalism and conservatism which were also present across all the various societies within ancient Greece. What inspired the Greeks to embark on their unique and enduring innovations? How did they think and feel about the new? This book represents the first serious attempt to address these issues, and deals with the phenomenon across all periods and areas of classical Greek history and thought.

"title : Aliens in ancient Egypt - author : Xaviant Hazecategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : ""The alien influences behind the rise and fall of Egypt's Golden Age Explains how Akhenaten was the last pharaoh entrusted with the sacred and ancient alien knowledge of stargates, free energy, and antigravity technologies Reveals how the Brotherhood of the Snake, a secret society of reptilian aliens, sought to destroy Akhenaten and suppress the sacred knowledge of the pharaohs Explores the original purpose of the pyramids--to transmit energy to expand consciousness--and how they were decommissioned after the Great Flood The sophisticated civilization of ancient Egypt arose seemingly overnight, complete with advanced levels of art, agriculture, astronomy, and physics. Then, with the death of Pharaoh Akhenaten, much of this higher knowledge was lost--or suppressed. But evidence of this former Golden Age, the alien visitors behind its rise, and those behind its decline still exists--some of it in plain sight. Examining the purposefully obscured reign of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, Xaviant Haze explains how they represent the last dynasty with access to the sacred knowledge of stargates, free energy, and antigravity technologies, knowledge handed down from an advanced interstellar race in the remote past. He reveals how the reptilian race known as the Shemsu Hor infiltrated the Egyptian priesthood and banking systems and formed the Brotherhood of the Snake--a secret society set on destroying Akhenaten's flourishing kingdom and suppressing the sacred knowledge of the pharaohs. Haze examines the evidence of aliens in ancient Egypt, such as the reptilian beings depicted in the Temple of Hathor, Thutmose III's alien encounter, and the spaceship hidden at Abydos. He shows how Akhenaten and his family are always portrayed with elongated skulls and explores the connection between ancient aliens and Mars, including the Martian materials used in Egyptian monuments. He explains the original purpose of the pyramids--to transmit uplifting energy throughout the planet to help expand consciousness--and explores how they were decommissioned after the Great Flood of prehistory. He reveals how the original builders of the pyramids foresaw humanity's fall from the Golden Age and strategically encoded these magnificent structures to wake humanity from the depths of the Dark Ages""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Gods of air and darkness - author : Mooney, Richard E.category : ancient_civilizationdescription : In Colony: Earth, Richard Mooney suggested that neither the theory of evolution nor the doctrine of divine creation accounts for the origins of humankind on this planet. He compiled masses of remarkable evidence, and theorized that earth was colonized by visitors from elsewhere in the universe who came to this planet with longer lifespans, greater intelligence, and a civilization far more sophisticated than anything earth has seen since. In Gods of Air and Darkness, Mooney asks: What happened to these colonizers? As he probes long dormant information, we learn that: * Thousands of years before the advent of quantum physics, ancient Indians, Phoenicians, and Greeks wrote about atomic particles and electron orbits and had measurements that could pinpoint half- lives of atomic particles. * Canadian and South American Indian tribes, Siberian shamans, and Chinese legends all refer to wars fought by celestial visitors using blinding rays, dragons of fire, and lightening - all of which sound remarkably like modern weapons: the laser, missiles, bombs, aircraft. * Ancient Indian texts describe ""flying spears"" that could ruin whole cities and detail the effects of radiation sickness - which until the Second World War, had never been observed. Mooney examines this and other persuasive evidence of ""lost"" civilizations and the catastrophe that engulfed them all, and suggests that a nuclear holocaust of global proportions may not only have destroyed whole peoples, but may also have changes the very climate of our planet.

"title : Supernatural: Meetings With the Ancient Teachers of Mankind - author : Graham Hancockcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Less than fifty thousand years ago mankind had no art, no religion, no sophisticated symbolism, no innovative thinking. Then, in a dramatic and electrifying change, described by scientists as ""the greatest riddle in human history,"" all the skills and qualities that we value most highly in ourselves appeared already fully formed, as though bestowed on us by hidden powers.  In Supernatural Graham Hancock sets out to investigate this mysterious ""beforeandafter moment"" and to discover the truth about the influences that gave birth to the modern human mind. His quest takes him on a detective journey from the stunningly beautiful painted caves of prehistoric France, Spain, and Italy to rock shelters in the mountains of South Africa, where he finds extraordinary Stone Age art. He uncovers clues that lead him to the depths of the Amazon rainforest to drink the powerful hallucinogen Ayahuasca with shamans, whose paintings contain images of ""supernatural beings"" identical to the animalhuman hybrids depicted in prehistoric caves. Hallucinogens such as mescaline also produce visionary encounters with exactly the same beings. Scientists at the cutting edge of consciousness research have begun to consider the possibility that such hallucinations may be real perceptions of other ""dimensions."" Could the ""supernaturals"" first depicted in the painted caves be the ancient teachers of mankind? Could it be that human evolution is not just the ""meaningless"" process that Darwin identified, but something more purposive and intelligent that we have barely begun to understand?  Graham Hancock is the author of Fingerprints of the Gods, Keeper of Genesis, The Mars Mystery, Heaven's Mirror, and Underworld, all number one bestsellers. The Guardian has credited him with having ""invented a new genre—an intellectual who-dunnit by a do-it-yourself sleuth."" Review    ""Graham Hancock is no stranger to controversy. The former journalist, whose books have sold five million copies in the past 10 years, has repeatedly dared to challenge scientific shibboleths, taking a run at entrenched thinking in archaeology, geology and astronomy.""    -The Globe and Mail  Reviewer: Guy Vincent    5.0 out of 5 stars, Verified Purchase Pushing the boundaries of psychedelic science    This book was recommended to me by one of the most educated and interesting friends I know - also educated in Western medicine.    I would have been resistant to ideas of fairies, aliens and machine elves, had I not experienced similar beings myself, during ayahuasca ceremonies in Peru with Shipibo shamans.    This book pushes the boundaries of biophysics, neuroscience and ethnobotany, and opens new ideas for research in psychedelic science. The connections between DMT and DNA make this book worth reading alone.    Read this, if you have an open mind, or are curious about our place in the physical and non-physical universes.  Reviewer: The Diab0lus    5.0 out of 5 stars, Verified Purchase If you've ever had doubts about the existence of the supernatural world, you wont after reading this    For all you book readers out there who want something good that will blow your mind, I would HIGHLY reccomend this gem. If you want a more in-depth understanding of the supernatural, how it applies to us as humans, and how it all works and functions from a practical and also a theoretical point of view, this is the book for you. Graham Hancock (the author) has always been a respectable and revolutionary archaeologist & investigator and is considered a pioneer in the realm of pre-history, archaeology, archaeoastronomy, anthropology, ancient religions & mythology and their origins, the occult, etc. All the hidden knowledge and information about human life on this planet and its origins can all be found in his books. I've always been a skeptical type of person, but all of his work is backed up with a solid foundation of evidence necessary to support it. Every single chapter of every one of his books that I've read was a mindblowing experience, I'll leave it at that.   Read more Read less"
"title : The Woman Who Would Be King: Hatshepsut's Rise to Power in Ancient Egypt - author : Kara Cooneycategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Hatshepsut—the daughter of a general who usurped Egypt's throne and a mother with ties to the previous dynasty—was born into a privileged position in the royal household, and she was expected to bear the sons who would legitimize the reign of her father’s family. Her failure to produce a male heir was ultimately the twist of fate that paved the way for her improbable rule as a cross-dressing king.  At just over twenty, Hatshepsut ascended to the rank of pharaoh in an elaborate coronation ceremony that set the tone for her spectacular reign as co-regent with Thutmose III, the infant king whose mother Hatshepsut out-maneuvered for a seat on the throne. Hatshepsut was a master strategist, cloaking her political power plays in the veil of piety and sexual reinvention. Just as women today face obstacles from a society that equates authority with masculinity, Hatshepsut shrewdly operated the levers of power to emerge as Egypt's second female pharaoh.

"title : Mysteries of the Ancient World - author : Louis de la Habacategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Massive sentinels of stone guard the rock-bound shores of tiny Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean. Man-made mountains, the pyramids of Egypt loom above the Nile. Sprawling ruins of Minoan palaces share the hillsides of Crete with age-old olive groves.    Despite decades of research, many such intriguing remnants of the past remain enigmas, often provoking questions rather than providing answers. In Mysteries of the Ancient World you will search through the secrets of long-dead cultures and civilizations and discover the riddles that still persist.    Ice Age hunters of more than 10,000 years ago painted the walls of scores of caves in France and Spain. Why? What do the drawings of these earliest artists mean? Without iron tools, horses, or even wheels, how did the Egyptians build the pyramids—and for what purpose? In a short span of time, the Mycenaeans of Greece amassed vast treasures. How? And what fears haunted their final decades? A startling demise overtook two other flourishing peoples: the Harappans of ancient India and the Etruscans of Italy. What chains of events brought these mighty civilizations to ruin?    In their attempts to understand the mysteries of the past, the authors and photographers of this book have combed the globe for clues. Probe the ruins of Jericho with them to investigate the origins of cities. Observe a summer solstice at the awesome monument of Stonehenge. Penetrate the eerie subterranean crypts of the Etruscans. From dusty archeological sites to book-lined dens, seek the expert advice of scholars who help interpret the enticing realms of old.    Striking photographs capture the land and the legacies of the ancients, and more than a dozen specially commissioned paintings re-create their lives. Mysteries of the Ancient World enriches the present by evoking the grandeur, the glory, and the puzzles of the past.    Weathered watchman, a 13-foot-high statue beholds its isolated home—Easter Island. How people there erected these gigantic stone figures—and why they later tried to destroy them—perplexes archeologists. Around the globe, similar mysteries defy solution.   Read more Read less"

But there were survivors-- known to later cultures by names such as 'the Sages', 'the Magicians', 'the Shining Ones', and 'the Mystery Teachers of Heaven'. They travelled the world in their great ships doing all in their power to keep the spark of civilization burning. They settled at key locations--Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, Baalbek in the Lebanon, Giza in Egypt, ancient Sumer, Mexico, Peru and across the Pacific where a huge pyramid has recently been discovered in Indonesia. Everywhere they went these 'Magicians of the Gods' brought with them the memory of a time when mankind had fallen out of harmony with the universe and paid a heavy price.

"title : Creators, conquerors, and citizens - author : Robin Waterfieldcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : ""We Greeks are one in blood and one in language; we have temples to the gods and religious rites in common, and a common way of life."" So the fifth-century historian Herodotus has some Athenians declare, in explanation of why they would never betray their fellow Greeks to the enemy, the ""barbarian"" Persians. And he might have added further common features, such as clothing, foodways, and political institutions. But if the Greeks knew that they were kin, why did many of them side with the Persians against fellow Greeks, and why, more generally, is ancient Greek history so often the history of internecine wars and other forms of competition with one another? This is the question acclaimed historian Robin Waterfield sets out to explore in this magisterial history of ancient Greece. With more information, more engagingly presented, than any similar work, this is the best single-volume account of ancient Greece in more than a generation. Waterfield gives a comprehensive narrative of seven hundred years of history, from the emergence of the Greeks around 750 BCE to the Roman conquest of the last of the Greco-Macedonian kingdoms in 30 BCE. Equal weight is given to all phases of Greek history -- the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods. But history is not just facts; it is also a matter of how we interpret the evidence. Without compromising the readability of the book, Waterfield incorporates the most recent scholarship by classical historians and archaeologists and asks his readers to think critically about Greek history. A brilliant, up-to-date account of ancient Greece, suitable for history buffs and university students alike, Creators, Conquerors, and Citizens presents a compelling and comprehensive story of this remarkable civilization's disunity, underlying cultural solidarity, and eventual political unification. ""--  ""A brilliant, up-to-date account of all of ancient Greek history (the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods), suitable for history buffs and university students, enlivened by a strong thesis about the disunity of the Greeks, their underlying cultural unity, and their eventual political unification""--   Read more Read less"

"title : And man created God - author : Selina O'Gradycategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : At the time of Jesus' birth, thousands of people were leaving their families and tribes behind and flocking into brand new multi-ethnic cities. The world was undergoing the first phase of globalization, and in this ferment rulers and ruled turned to religion as a source of order and stability. The world was full of gods, competing and merging with one another. Selina O'Grady takes the reader on a journey across the empires of the ancient world and introduces us to rulers, merchants, messiahs, priests and holy men. Throughout, she seeks to answer why, amongst the countless options available, the empires at the time ""chose"" the religions they did? Why did China's rulers hitch their fate to Confucianism, a philosophy more than a religion? And why was a tiny Jewish cult eventually adopted by Rome's emperors rather than the far more popular and widespread cult of Isis? O'Grady looks at why and how religions have had such an immense impact on human history and in doing so uncovers the ineradicable connection between politics and religion--a connection which still defines us in our own age.--From publisher description.

"title : Voyages of the pyramid builders - author : Robert M. Schochcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Is it a mere coincidence that pyramids are found throughout our globe? Did cultures ranging across vast spaces in geography and time, such as the ancient Egyptians; early Bud-dhists; the Maya, Inca, Toltec, and Aztec civilizations of the Americas; the Celts of the British Isles; and even the Mississippi Indians of pre-Columbus Illinois, simply dream the same dreams and envision the same structures?Robert M. Schoch-one of the world's preeminent geologists in recasting the date of the building of the Great Sphinx-believes otherwise. In this dramatic and meticulously reasoned book, Schoch, like anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl in his classic Kon-Tiki, argues that ancient cultures traveled great distances by sea. Indeed, he believes that primeval sailors traveled from the Eastern continent, primarily Southeast Asia, and spread the idea of pyramids across the globe, particularly to the New World of the Americas where they abounded until the days of the Conquistadors.

The escaped House officials no longer send food, and the city is starving. When the moderate leader Aceline is murdered, the trail leads Kata to a mysterious book that explains how to control the fabled Prism of Alerion. But when the last person to possess the book is found dead, it becomes clear that a conspiracy is afoot. At its center is former House Officiate Armand, who has hidden the Prism. Armand is vying for control of the Directorate, the highest political position in the city, until Armand is betrayed and sent to a prison camp to mine deadly bloodstone. Meanwhile, Maximilian is sharing his mind with another being: the joker-god Aya. Aya leads Max to the realm of the Elo-Talern to seek a power source to remove Aya from Max's brain. But when Max and Aya return, they find the vigilants destroying the last remnants of House power. It seems the seditionists' hopes for a new age of peace and prosperity in Caeli-Amur have come to naught, and every attempt to improve the situation makes it worse. The question now is not just whether Kata, Max, and Armand can do anything to stop the bloody battle in the city, but if they can escape with their lives.   Read more Read less"

"title : Shamanism and the drug propaganda - author : Russell, Dancategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Book Description    Publication Date: January 1, 1998    Also see volume two in this series, “Strategic Suicide,” the modern American history. Contact the author on drugwar.com.  ""Shamanism and the Drug Propaganda"" is a popularly written college-level introduction to ancient history and the Greek classics. The text is fully annotated and illuminated by 200 genuine pharmaco-shamanic images from the ancient world.  Since it is popularly written, and very heavily illustrated with the remarkable, overtly pharmaco-shamanic art of the ancient world, it reads like a movie. But a movie with profound psychological and political relevance for the contemporary world, since it uses the words and pictures of our ancestors to address contemporary issues. As such, the book is a unique tool for exciting undergraduates about the contemporary relevance of ancient history and the Greek classics.  This was the intent of Jane Ellen Harrison in her ""Prolegomena"" and ""Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religion."" Harrison was the most influential classicist of the twentieth century, and, not coincidentally, the most influential feminist historian of the century as well. A major feature of ""Shamanism and the Drug Propaganda,"" in 4 of its 17 chapters, is its summary of Harrison's seminal thesis, in her own words.  Harrison was concerned with the historical and psychological transition from the originary matriarchal consciousness of tribal culture to the warrior-oriented patriarchal consciousness of industrial culture. She understood this transition to be central to the process of industrial enslavement. That enslavement necessarily demonized the power-rites, the rites de passage, as she called them, of tribal cultures. That is, Harrison pointed to the tribal, the matriarchal pre-industrial roots of Classical, patriarchal-industrial, Greek culture.  She was, therefore, concerned with originary, tribal, Greek sacramentalism. Herbal magic, real pharmaco-shamanism, is at the core of all matriarchal cultures. The Goddess does not separate from her herbal magic, from her invention of medicine.  The central sacrament of all Paleolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures known is an inebriative herb, a plant totem, which became metaphoric of the communal epiphany. These herbs, herbal concoctions and herbal metaphors are at the heart of all mythologies. They include such familiar images as the Burning Bush, the Tree of Life, the Cross, the Golden Bough, the Forbidden Fruit, the Blood of Christ, the Blood of Dionysos, the Holy Grail (or rather its contents), the Chalice (Kalyx:'flower cup'), the Golden Flower (Chrysanthemon), Ambrosia (Ambrotos:'immortal'), Nectar (Nektar:'overcomes death'), the Sacred Lotus, the Golden Apples, the Mystic Mandrake, the Mystic Rose, the Divine Mushroom (teonanacatl), the Divine Water Lily, Soma, Ayahuasca ('Vine of the Soul'), Kava, Iboga, Mama Coca and Peyote Woman.  They are the archetypal - the emotionally, the instantaneously understood - symbols at the center of the drug propaganda. A sexually attractive man or woman is an archetypal image, the basis of most advertising. A loaf of bread is an archetypal image. The emotional impact of the sacramental herbal images, or, rather, the historical confusion of their natural function, is central to the successful manipulation of mass emotion and individual self-image.  That is, contemporary politics has an unconscious, an evolutionary element, that involves the industrial slaver manipulation of instinct. That manipulation can only be understood by contemplating what elements of our tribal cultural inheritance contemporary industrial slavers want forgotten. This book is a pictorial remembrance of that shamanic inheritance.   Read more Read less"

"title : Ancient worlds - author : Michael Scottcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Twenty-five-hundred years ago, civilizations around the world entered a revolutionary new era that overturned old order and laid the foundation for our world today. In the face of massive social changes across three continents, radical new forms of government emerged; mighty wars were fought over trade, religion, and ideology; and new faiths were ruthlessly employed to unify vast empires. The histories of Rome and China, Greece and India-- the stories of Constantine and Confucius, Qin Shi Huangdi and Hannibal-- are here revealed to be interconnected incidents in the midst of a greater drama. In Ancient Worlds, historian Michael Scott presents a gripping narrative of this unique age in human civilization, showing how diverse societies responded to similar pressures and how they influenced one another:  through conquest and conversion, through trade in people, goods, and ideas. An ambitious reinvention of our grandest histories, Ancient Worlds reveals new truths about our common human heritage.--   Read more Read less"
"title : The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Civilizations - author : John Haywoodcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Civilizations explores the world's earliest cultures, from the farming settlements of Mesopotamia to the Americas and Polynesia, via the birth of Greek city states and the foundation of Rome. It examines the development of civilizations in the Near East -- Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian -- as well as those in Europe -- the Minoans, Etruscans and Celts. Across the continents of Africa, Asia and America, it covers such subjects as Egypt from its pre-dynastic roots to the age of the Pharaohs, China during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the great cities of the Incas and Aztecs. Vivid descriptions of civilizations are complemented by discussion of such key topics as colonization, agriculture and technology, and the rise of empires and city states. Richly illustrated with timelines, photographs, artwork re-creations and full-colour maps, this is an illuminating and multi-faceted one-volume introduction to early peoples and the worlds they created. - Back cover.

"title : Hidden History - author : Brian Haughtoncategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Despite being enmeshed in a culture steeped in technology and science, the magic and mysteries of the ancient world can still haunt our imagination. Through their architecture, artifacts and deeds, ancient cultures speak to us across thousands of dusty years--from the labyrinthine palace of Knossos on Crete and the lofty pyramids of Egypt to the remotest jungle temples of Peru and the megalithic mystery of Stonehenge. Hidden History brings together a fascinating selection of these ancient enigmas, arranging them into three sections: Mysterious Places, Unexplained Artifacts, and Enigmatic People.    You'll discover fascinating facts about:    The Great Sphinx--Mysticism and archaeology collide in the ongoing debate over this enigmatic monument.    Mystery Hill--Who built the intriguing megalithic complex lying 40 miles north of Boston?    The Antikythera Mechanism--An ancient Greek computer found beneath the Aegean Sea.    The Giant Hill-Figures of England--The Uffington White Horse and other huge chalk figures cut into the English countryside thousands of years ago.    The Queen of Sheba--Clues to the real identity of this mighty ruler famous for her Biblical visit to King Solomon    Newgrange--Hundreds of years older than the Giza Pyramid and Stonehenge. Who were the builders of this Irish megalithic monument?    Hidden History fills the gap between archaeology and alternative history using the latest available data and a common sense, open-minded approach. The book discusses not only ancient history's major mysteries, but also some of the puzzles of alternative history--like the ""Coso Artifact,"" the possibility of ancient flight, and the mysterious ""Voynich Manuscript""--as well as mysterious peoples from the Magi and the Druids to the Knights Templar and the Green Children. With more than 50 photographs and illustrations, this is the ideal reference work for those interested in the archaeology of these great enigmas.   Read more Read less"

"title : Uriel's machine - author : Christopher Knightcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Modern scientific investigations show that Earth has been hit many times by objects such as comets and meteorites. Laboratory work on comet impact effects demonstrates that comets could cause tidal waves to exceed three miles tall and near 400 miles per hour. In the last 10,000 years, there have been two impacts of such proportion: a seven-fold impact into all the world's oceans around 7640 B.C., and a single impact into the Mediterranean Sea about 3150 B.C., the time of Noah's Flood. Uriel's Machine proves ancient Europeans not only survived the 7640 B.C. flood, but developed a highly advanced civilization dedicated to predicting and preparing for future meteoric impacts. Building an international network of sophisticated astronomical observatories, these ancient astronomers created accurate solar, lunar, and planetary calendars, measured the diameter of the Earth, and precisely predicted comet collisions years in advance. This was the true purpose of megalithic structures such as Stonehenge. In 3150 B.C., the ancients' predictions proved true, and their device - Uriel's Machine - allowed the reconstruction of civilization in a shattered world. Uriel's Machine also presents evidence that: There was a single global language on Earth; A single female was a common ancestor to all living humans; Angels bred with human women to create The Watchers, giant half-human beings; The oral tradition of Freemasonry records real events. A fascinating study of humankind's past, present, and future, Uriel's Machine proves the world was indeed flooded, but survived wholly due to these ancient Europeans, their heavenly knowledge, and one remarkable machine.

"title : Heaven's Mirror: Quest for the Lost Civilization - author : Graham Hancockcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : In Heaven's Mirror, author Graham Hancock continues the quest begun in his international best-seller Fingerprints of the Gods: to rediscover the hidden legacy of mankind and to reveal that ""ancient"" cultures were, in fact, the heirs to a far older forgotten civilization and the inheritors of its archaic, mystical wisdom.  Working with photographer Santha Faiia, Hancock traces a network of sacred sites around the globe on a spectacular voyage of discovery that takes us from the pyramids and temples of ancient Egypt to the enigmatic statues of Easter Island, from the haunting ruins of pre-Columbian America to the splendors of Angkor Wat. It is a journey through myth, magic, and astounding archaeological revelations that forces us to rethink the cultures of our lost ancestors and the origins of civilization.  The first fully illustrated book by Graham Hancock, Heaven's Mirror is a stunning and illuminating tour of the spirituality of the ancients--a search for a secret recorded in the very foundations of the holiest sites of antiquity.  Amazon.com Review It could be true! That's the enthusiasm that author and scholar-mystic Graham Hancock counts on--in himself and in his readers--as he lays down his theories of an ancient (Atlantean, perhaps?) civilization that disseminated a sophisticated religion of ground-sky dualism and a ""science"" of immortality. Hancock's previous work, including the popular and controversial Fingerprints of the Gods, has drawn criticism for its leaps of faith and allegedly pseudoscientific conclusions, but Heaven's Mirror proves at least a little more substantial. His chief thesis is that numerous ancient sites and monuments--the pyramids of Mexico and Egypt, the ruins of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the monuments of Yonaguni in the Pacific, and the megaliths of Peru and Bolivia--are situated in such a way, geodetically, that they point towards some separate and uniform influence, some lost civilization or ""invisible college"" of astronomer-priests. And that civilization, as evidenced in the mathematics and architecture of the sites, points towards some gnosis, or body of knowledge, that would allow humanity to transcend the trap of mortality, a worldview in which the knowledge-giving serpent of Eden is not a villain but a hero.    Whatever you think of Hancock's ideas and theoretical musings in archaeo-astronomy, Heaven's Mirror is a gorgeous book, thanks to the photography of Santha Faiia. Lush, evocative photos of the monoliths on Easter Island and temples deep in the Cambodian jungle are enough to set the mind to introspective wandering--maybe, just maybe, Hancock's got it right after all. --Paul Hughes   Read more Read less"

"title : De klassieke wereld in 52 ontdekkingen - author : Leonard Victor Rutgerscategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Zo'n 2500 jaar geleden voltrok zich rond de Middellandse Zee een culturele revolutie die zijn weerga niet kent. Grieken en Romeinen, Feniciërs en Etrusken, en weldra ook Joden en Christenen, allemaal droegen ze eraan bij, of het nu ging om de ontwikkeling van een monetaire economie of een gedegen staatsinrichting, het beantwoorden van de grote levensvragen, het uitdenken van filosofische en theologische systemen, of baanbrekende ontwikkelingen op het gebied van kunst en techniek. 0Dat de klassieke wereld onuitwisbare sporen heeft nagelaten in de onze, is duidelijk. Maar wat is er nu werkelijk overgebleven van het gedachtegoed en de prestaties van toen? Welke betekenis heeft de culturele revolutie van destijds eigenlijk nog voor de mens van nu? 0In dit rijk geïllustreerde boek neemt Leonard Rutgers de lezer mee op een fascinerende ontdekkingsreis langs een groot aantal bekende en minder bekende etappes in de geschiedenis van de antieke wereld. Aan de hand van archeologische vondsten vertelt hij helder en meeslepend over deze nog altijd relevante tijd, waarin originele denkers en doeners telkens opnieuw voor verrassende ontwikkelingen zorgden. 0Van het Parthenon tot sjoemel-mummies, van het Colosseum tot het voedselpatroon van de eerste christenen, en van een fantastische houten teenprothese tot een rabbijn die aan piraterij doet, alles komt voorbij. In de handen van Rutgers is het verleden springlevend en verbazingwekkend actueel.   Read more Read less"

"title : Prehistory - author : Colin Renfrewcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : In Prehistory, the award-winning archaeologist and renowned scholar Colin Renfrew covers human existence before the advent of written records--which is to say, the overwhelming majority of our time here on earth. But Renfrew also opens up to discussion, and even debate, the term ""prehistory"" itself, giving an incisive, concise, and lively survey of the past, and how scholars and scientists labor to bring it to light. Renfrew begins by looking at prehistory as a discipline, particularly how developments of the past century and a half--advances in archaeology and geology; Darwin's ideas of evolution; discoveries of artifacts and fossil evidence of our human ancestors; and even more enlightened museum and collection curatorship--have fueled continuous growth in our knowledge of prehistory. He details how breakthroughs such as radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis have helped us to define humankind's past--how things have changed--much more clearly than was possible just a half century ago. Answers for why things have changed, however, continue to elude us, so Renfrew discusses some of the issues and challenges past and present that confront the study of prehistory and its investigators. In the book's second part, Renfrew shifts the narrative focus, offering a summary of human prehistory from early hominids to the rise of literate civilization that is refreshingly free from conventional wisdom and grand ""unified"" theories. The author's own case studies encompass a vast geographical and chronological range--the Orkney Islands, the Balkans, the Indus Valley, Peru, Ireland, and China--and help to explain the formation and development of agriculture and centralized societies. He concludes with a fascinating chapter on early writing systems, ""From Prehistory to History."" In this invaluable, brief account of human development prior to the last four millennia, Colin Renfrew delivers a meticulously researched and passionately argued chronicle about our life on earth, and our ongoing quest to understand it.From the Hardcover edition.

Malkowski makes otherwise daunting technical information accessible and readable. I enjoyed this book thoroughly.""—John Anthony West, author of Serpent in the Sky: The High Wisdom of Ancient Egypt""Ed Malkowski has presented a concise digest of modern research on the early origins of human civilization. His insights regarding the emergence of Cro-Magnon man alone are worth the price of the book!""—Christopher Dunn, author of The Giza Power Plant: Technologies of Ancient EgyptIn the late nineteenth century, French explorer Augustus Le Plongeon, after years of research in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, concluded that the Mayan and Egyptian civilizations were related—as remnants of a once greater and highly sophisticated culture. The discoveries of modern researchers over the last two decades now support this once derided speculation with evidence revealing that the Sphinx is thousands of years older than Egyptologists have claimed, that the Great Pyramid was not a tomb but a geomechanical power plant, and that the megaliths of the Nabta Playa reveal complex astronomical star maps that existed 4,000 years before conventional historians deemed such knowledge possible.Much of the past support for prehistoric civilization has relied on esoteric traditions and mythic narrative. Using hard scientific evidence from the fields of archaeology, genetics, engineering, and geology, as well as sacred and religious texts, Malkowski shows that these mythic narratives are based on actual events and that a highly sophisticated civilization did once exist prior to those of Egypt and Sumer. Tying its cataclysmic fall to the mysterious disappearance of Cro-Magnon culture, Before the Pharaohs offers a compelling new view of humanity's past.EDWARD F.

"title : Being Human - author : Margaret S. Archercategory : anthropologydescription : Humanity and the very notion of the human subject are under threat from postmodernist thinking which has declared not only the 'Death of God' but also the 'Death of Man'. This book is a revindication of the concept of humanity, rejecting contemporary social theory that seeks to diminish human properties and powers. Archer argues that being human depends on an interaction with the real world in which practice takes primacy over language in the emergence of human self-consciousness, thought, emotionality and personal identity - all of which are prior to, and more basic than, our acquisition of a social identity. This original and provocative new book from leading social theorist Margaret S. Archer builds on the themes explored in her previous books Culture and Agency (CUP 1988) and Realist Social Theory (CUP 1995). It will be required reading for academics and students of social theory, cultural theory, political theory, philosophy and theology.   Read more Read less"
"title : On the people's terms - author : Philip Pettitcategory : anthropologydescription : ""According to republican political theory, choosing freely requires being able to make the choice without subjection to another and freedom as a person requires being publicly protected against subjection in the exercise of basic liberties. But there is no public protection without a coercive state. And doesn't state coercion necessarily take from the freedom of the coerced? Philip Pettit addresses this question from a civic republican perspective, arguing that state interference does not involve subjection or domination if there is equally shared, popular control over government""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Social Media in South India - author : Shriram Venkatramancategory : anthropologydescription : One of the first ethnographic studies to explore use of social media in the everyday lives of people in Tamil Nadu, Social Media in South India provides an understanding of this subject in a region experiencing rapid transformation. The influx of IT companies over the past decade into what was once a space dominated by agriculture has resulted in a complex juxtaposition between an evolving knowledge economy and the traditions of rural life. While certain class tensions have emerged in response to this juxtaposition, a study of social media in the region suggests that similarities have also transpired, observed most clearly in the blurring of boundaries between work and life for both the old residents and the new.

"title : Ethnographies of Breastfeeding - author : Tanya Cassidycategory : anthropologydescription : ""Studies of breastfeeding have proliferated over the last decade. Breastfeeding is an intimate and deep-rooted bodily practice and yet also a highly controversial sociocultural process, invoking strong reactions from advocates and opponents. Whilst breastfeeding practices and experiences vary greatly in different parts of the world, reducing infant mortality is a pressing international goal for governments and societies. Representing cross-cultural concerns of researchers, policy-makers and mothers, this important book takes a rich ethnographic survey of breastfeeding all over the world. Breastfeeding is shown to highlight various links between gender, power and resources in culture. Each chapter covers a new topic and ethnic or national group, and major topical themes of research such as the rise of milk banks, mother-to-mother sharing networks facilitated by social media, breast milk and HIV are explored""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago - author : Peter S. Bellwoodcategory : anthropologydescription : Since its publication in 1985, Peter Bellwood’s Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago has been hailed as the sole authoritative work on the subject by the leading expert in the field. Now that work has been fully revised and includes a complete up-to-date summary of the archaeology of the region (and relevant neighboring areas of China and Oceania), as well as a comprehensive discussion of new and important issues (such as the “Eve-Garden of Eden” hypothesis and its relevance to the Indo-Malaysian region) and recent advances in macrofamily linguistic classification. Moving north to south from northern Peninsular Malaysia to Timor and west to east from Sumatra to the Moluccas, Bellwood describes human prehistory from initial hominid settlement more than one million years ago to the eve of historical Hindu-Buddhist and Islamic cultures of the region. The archaeological record provides the central focus, but chapters also incorporate essential information from the paleoenvironmental sciences, biological anthropology, linguistics, and social anthropology. Bellwood approaches questions about past cultural and biological developments in the region from a multidisciplinary perspective. Historical issues given extended treatment include the significance of the Homo erectus populations of Java, the dispersal of the present Austronesian-speaking peoples of the region within the past 4,000 years, and the spread of metallurgy since 500 B.C. Bellwood also discusses relationships between the prehistoric populations of the archipelago and those of neighboring regions such as Australia, New Guinea, and mainland Asia.   Read more Read less"
"title : Rape in the Nordic Countries - author : May-Len Skilbreicategory : anthropologydescription : While the Nordic countries are listed at the top in most international rankings of gender equality and citizens? feelings of security, studies on the prevalence of sexual victimisation present a different picture, suggesting that the very countries that have invested much in establishing gender equality actually see a high prevalence of sexual violence. This book sheds light on the phenomenon and construction of rape and other forms of sexual violence within the Nordic region, exploring the ways in which rape and sexual violence are dealt with through criminal law and considering governmental policies aimed at combatting it, with a special focus on legal regulations and developments. Thematically organised, it offers new research on perpetrators, victimhood, criminal justice and prevention. Multi-disciplinary in approach, it brings together the latest work from a range of scholars to offer insights into the situation in the five Nordic countries, asking how and why rape and other forms of sexual violence occur, whilst also addressing the timely issues of online sexual cultures, BDSM and the grey areas of sexual offences. As such, it will appeal to scholars of sociology, criminology and law with interests in gender and sexual violence.   Read more Read less"
"title : A recent history of lesbian and gay psychology - author : Peter Hegartycategory : anthropologydescription : ""[This work] explores the contemporary history of how psychological research, practice, and theory has engaged with gay and lesbian movements in the United States and beyond, over the last 50 years. Peter Hegarty examines the main strands of research in lesbian and gay psychology that have emerged since the de-pathologizing of homosexuality in the 1970s that followed from the recognition of homophobia and societal prejudice. The author details the expansion of 'lesbian and gay psychology' to 'LGB' to 'LGBT psychology' via its paradigm shifts, legal activism, shifts in policy makers' and mental health professionals' goals in regard to sexual and gender minorities. For the first time, the origins of the concepts, debates, and major research programs that have made up the field of LGBT psychology have been drawn together in a single historical narrative, making this a unique resource. A case is made that psychology has only very lately come to consider the needs and issues of transgender and intersex people, and that LGB paradigms need to be critically interrogated to understand how they can be best brokered to bring about social change for such groups. A Recent History of Lesbian and Gay Psychology will serve as an advanced historical introduction to this field's recent history and current concerns, and will inform both those who have been a part of this history and students who are new to the field.""--Provided by publisher.

"title : The coddling of the American mind - author : Greg Lukianoffcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Something is going wrong on many college campuses in the last few years. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising. Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and afraid to speak honestly. How did this happen? First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: what doesn't kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three Great Untruths are incompatible with basic psychological principles, as well as ancient wisdom from many cultures. They interfere with healthy development. Anyone who embraces these untruths--and the resulting culture of safetyism--is less likely to become an autonomous adult able to navigate the bumpy road of life. Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to produce these untruths. They situate the conflicts on campus in the context of America's rapidly rising political polarization, including a rise in hate crimes and off-campus provocation. They explore changes in childhood including the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade. This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Into the heart - author : Good, Kenneth.category : anthropologydescription : This is an absorbing, thrilling account of an American anthropologist’s foray into the heart of the Amazon, where for twelve years he lived among the Yanomama, learned their language, was accepted into their world, fell in love with one of their women, then found himself in a harrowing life-and- death struggle to keep from losing her. When Ken Good first traveled down the Orinoco to the Amazon rain forest, he was a student of Napoleon Chagnon, the scholar who first introduced the world to those he called “the fierce people,” a Stone Age tribe who lived on hallucinogenic drugs and reveled in killing. The Yanomama were known as nomads who trekked through the forest in a perpetual hunt to satisfy their hunger; they were characterized as brutal and barbaric, proof that mankind in its natural state is anything but noble. INTO THE HEART is Good’s own eye-opening observations of the Yanomama, a description of a people so intense and vibrant that their world comes alive on the page. Good came to know them intimately: living as they lived, hanging his hammock alongside theirs, and chronicling their ways as completely as any outsider ever has. He tells us about the Yanomania’s methods of survival in a hard jungle, their coming-of-age rites, courting habits, hunting, warring, and drug rituals. They called him shori, brother-in- law, and in time the tribe elder advised him to do what every other Yanomama man his age should do - become betrothed to one of the tribe’s young girls. Her name was Yarima. As the years passed and she entered womanhood, she and Good fell deeply in love. INTO THE HEART is the story of that extraordinary marriage across cultures - of the times Good would be called away from the Amazon only to lose her to the jungle; of his desperate searches to find her and reclaim her as his wife. When Good understood that he and Yarima could never be separated again, he brought her out of the Amazon. But Yarima might as well have been from another planet for all her knowledge of her husband’s world. She had never seen flat, uncleared land, much less land with houses and cars. She had never worn clothes or walked in shoes. It is this moving love story that distinguishes Ken Good’s narrative from any other work on a primitive culture. Sure to rank with the most exciting books in its genre, INTO THE HEART is an unforgettable account of an extraordinary journey. BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less"

Social responses to it depend both on the nature of the illness and on cultural interpretation of its significance. This study of the occurrence, recognition and explanation of illness amongst the Gnau makes use of its author's dual training in medicine and anthropology to show why, how far, and in what respects these people of a forest village in New Guinea turn to their religious and magical knowledge in the distress of illness.

"title : Significant Life - author : Todd Maycategory : anthropologydescription : What makes for a good life, or a beautiful one, or, perhaps most important, a meaningful one? Throughout history most of us have looked to our faith, our relationships, or our deeds for the answer. But in A Significant Life, philosopher Todd May offers an exhilarating new way of thinking about these questions, one deeply attuned to life as it actually is: a work in progress, a journey -- and often a narrative. Offering moving accounts of his own life and memories alongside rich engagements with philosophers from Aristotle to Heidegger, he shows us where to find the significance of our lives: in the way we live them.  --Publisher's description.

"title : Northeast Migrants in Delhi - author : Duncan McDuie-Racategory : anthropologydescription : Northeast Migrants in Delhi: Race, Refuge and Retail is an ethnographic study of migrants from India's north-east border region living and working in Delhi, the nation's capital. Northeast India borders China, the Himalayas, and Southeast Asia. Despite burgeoning interest in the region, little attention is given to the thousands of migrants leaving the region for Indian cities for refuge, work, and study. The stories of Northeast migrants reveal an everyday Northeast India rarely captured elsewhere and offer an alternative view of contemporary India. Northeast migrants covet the employment opportunities created by India's embrace of globalization; shopping malls, restaurants, and call centres. Yet Northeast migrants also experience high levels of racism, harassment, and violence. Far from simply victims of the city, Northeast migrants have created their own 'map' of Delhi, enabling a sense of belonging, albeit an uneasy one. Interdisciplinary in nature, this book will appeal to scholars of anthropology, urban studies, geography, migration, and Asian Studies.  Dit baanbrekende boek is een etnografische studie naar de migranten die in steeds grotere getale van het noordoosten van India naar de hoofdstad Delhi trekken. De sociale, politieke en economische activiteiten van deze etnische minderheden bieden een heel andere kijk op het hedendaagse India. Door de opkomst van het neoliberale globalisme in India vinden deze migranten in Delhi volop werk in restaurants en supermarkten, maar worden zij daar ook geconfronteerd met racisme en geweld. Tegelijkertijd zoeken ze in hun nieuwe omgeving naar een eigen identiteit.   Read more Read less"
"title : Abnormal - author : Michel Foucaultcategory : anthropologydescription : El curso sobre Los anormales, dictado en el Collége de France entre enero y marzo de 1975, prolonga los análisis que Michel Foucault consagró desde 1970 a la cuestión del saber y el poder: poder disciplinario, poder de normalización, biopoder.  A partir de múltiples fuentes teológicas, jurídicas y médicas, Foucault enfoca el problema de esos individuos peligrosos a quienes, en el siglo XIX, se denomino ""anormales"". Define sus tres figuras principales: los monstruos, que hacen referencia a las leyes de la naturaleza y las normas de la sociedad; los incorregibles, de quienes se encargan los nuevos dispositivos de domesticación del cuerpo; y los onanístas, que alimentan, desde el siglo xvin, una campaña orientada al disciplinamiento de la familia moderna.  Los análisis de Foucault toman como punto de partida las pericias médico legales que aún se practicaban en la década de 1950. Esboza a continuación una arqueología del instinto y del deseo, a partir de las técnicas de la revelación en la confesión y en la dirección de conciencia. De ese modo, Foucault plantea las premisas históricas y teóricas de trabajos que retomará, modificará y reelaborará en su enseñanza en el Collége de France y las obras ulteriores. Este curso representa, por lo tanto, un elemento esencial para seguir las investigaciones de Foucault en su formación, sus prolongaciones y sus desarrollos.   Read more Read less"

"title : Tyneside Neighbourhoods - author : Daniel Nettlecategory : anthropologydescription : ""Nettle’s book presents the results of five years of comparative ethnographic fieldwork in two different neighbourhoods of the same British city, Newcastle upon Tyne. The neighbourhoods are only a few kilometres apart, yet whilst one is relatively affluent, the other is amongst the most economically deprived in the UK. Tyneside Neighbourhoods uses multiple research methods to explore social relationships and social behaviour, attempting to understand whether the experience of deprivation fosters social solidarity, or undermines it. The book is distinctive in its development of novel quantitative methods for ethnography: systematic social observation, economic games, household surveys, crime statistics, and field experiments. Nettle analyses these findings in the context of the cultural, psychological and economic consequences of economic deprivation, and of the ethical difficulties of representing a deprived community.

"title : Worlds in Miniature - author : Jack Davycategory : anthropologydescription : Miniaturisation is the creation of small objects that resemble larger ones, usually, but not always, for purposes different to those of the larger original object. Worlds in Miniature brings together researchers working across various regions, time periods and disciplines to explore the subject of miniaturisation as a material culture technique. It offers original contribution to the field of miniaturisation through its broad geographical scope, interdisciplinary approach, and deep understanding of miniatures and their diverse contexts.  Beginning with an introduction by the editors, which offers one possible guide to studying and comparing miniatures, the following chapters include studies of miniature Neolithic stone circles on Exmoor, Ancient Egyptian miniature assemblages, miniaturisation under colonialism as practiced by the Makah People of Washington State, miniature surf boats from India, miniaturised contemporary tourist art of the Warao people of Venezuela, and dioramas on display in the Science Museum.  Interspersing the chapters are interviews with miniature-makers, including two miniature boat-builders at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall and a freelance architectural model-maker. Professor Susanne Küchler concludes the volume with a theoretical study summarising the current state of miniaturisation as a research discipline. The interdisciplinary nature of the volume makes it suitable reading for anthropologists, archaeologists, historians and artists, and for researchers in related fields across the social sciences.

"title : Antropología filosófica - author : Gabriel Amengualcategory : anthropologydescription : Se ha discutido si la antropología en la modernidad se ha convertido en el centro de la filosofía. De hecho, la antropología es como un cruce de caminos en el que confluyen muchas cuestiones filosóficas. El hombre mismo es una cuestión cuya complejidad extiende sus hilos a todo el campo de la filosofía. La realidad toda se entreteje en sus fibras, de ahí la caracterización renacentista del hombre como microcosmos. El carácter corporal y social, la afectividad, el lenguaje y, especialmente, la mente y el carácter personal muestran de qué «material» está hecho el hombre, cómo está equipado. Otros rasgos, como identidad, libertad, actividad, historicidad, cultura y sociedad, enseñan cuál es la tarea a la que está destinado. Finalmente, otros indican los límites en los que discurre su existencia y ayudan a trazar los perfiles: el mal, la caída, la culpa y la muerte. Estos límites reflejan, además, una experiencia muy actual: el carácter vulnerable del hombre.   Read more Read less"
"title : Forensic detective - author : Mann, Robert W.category : anthropologydescription : Death. It's not only inevitable and frightening, it's intriguing and fascinating--especially today, when science continues to make ever more stunning advances in the investigation of the oldest and darkest of mysteries. To discover the how and why of death, unearth its roots, and expose the mechanics of its grim handiwork is, at least in some sense, to master it. And in the process, if a criminal can be caught or closure found, so much the better.Enter Robert Mann, forensic anthropologist, deputy scientific director of the U.S. government's Central Identification Laboratory, and, some might say, the Sherlock Holmes of death detectives. When the dead reveal some of their most sensational, macabre, and poignant tales, more often than not it's Mann who's been listening. Now, in this remarkable casebook, he offers an in-depth behind-the-scenes portrait of his sometimes gruesome, frequently dangerous, and always compelling profession. In cases around the world, Mann has been called upon to unmask killers with nothing but the bones of their victims to guide him, draw out clues that restore identities to the nameless dead, recover remains thought to be hopelessly lost, and piece together the events that can unlock the truth behind the most baffling deaths.The infamous 9/11 terror attacks, which killed thousands; the unplanned killing that inaugurated serial murderer Jeffrey Dahmer's grisly spree; mysterious military fatalities from World War II to the Cold War to Vietnam, including the amazing case of the Vietnam War's Unknown Soldier--all the fascinating stories are here, along with photos from the author's personal files. Mystery hangings, mass graves, errant body parts, actual skeletons in closets, and a host of homicides steeped in bizarre clues and buried secrets--they're all in a day's work for one dedicated detective whose job begins when a life ends.From the Hardcover edition.

"title : Contagion and the State in Europe, 1830-1930 - author : Peter Baldwincategory : anthropologydescription : This book is a groundbreaking study of the historical reasons for the divergence in public health policies adopted in Britain, France, Germany and Sweden, and the spectrum of responses to the threat of contagious diseases such as cholera, smallpox and syphilis. In particular the book examines the link between politics and prevention. Did the varying political regimes influence the styles of precaution adopted? Or was it, as Peter Baldwin argues, a matter of more basic differences between nations, above all their geographic placement in the epidemiological trajectory of contagion, that helped shape their responses and their basic assumptions about the respective claims of the sick and of society, and fundamental political decisions for and against different styles of statutory intervention? Thus the book seeks to use medical history to illuminate broader questions of the development of statutory intervention and the comparative and divergent evolution of the modern state in Europe.

"title : Antisemitism and the left - author : Philip Spencercategory : anthropologydescription : ""Universalism has always shown two faces to the world: one emancipatory and inclusionary, the other repressive and exclusionary. Jewish experience of universalism has been correspondingly equivocal. Antisemitism and the left provides an original and stimulating study of modern antisemitism, tracing the intellectual and political struggles between these two opposed perspectives. At times, universalism has acted as a stimulus for Jewish emancipation, for civil, political and social inclusion. But it has also been used to justify hatred of Jews, depicting them as hostile to the entire human race, in ways even more sinister than those found in pre-modern and largely Christian traditions of anti-Judaism. A key feature of this repressive and exclusionary universalism and the distinctly modern form of antisemitism it has generated has been the construction of a putative 'Jewish question', which somehow needs to be 'solved'. This book provides conceptual analysis of the struggles waged within the Enlightenment, Marxism, critical Jewish thought and the contemporary left, engaging with such key authors as Mendelssohn, Marx, Adorno and Horkheimer, Arendt and Habermas, to critique the very notion of the 'Jewish question' and rescue universalism from the antisemitic morass into which it has too often fallen.  Antisemitism and the left will appeal to students, lecturers and the general reader interested in antisemitism and/or in principles of universalism, spanning the fields of politics, sociology, history, philosophy and Jewish studies.

"title : Imagining transgender - author : David Valentinecategory : anthropologydescription : Imagining Transgender is an ethnography of the emergence and institutionalization of transgender as a category of collective identity and political activism. Embraced by activists in the early 1990s to advocate for gender-variant people, the category quickly gained momentum in public health, social service, scholarly, and legislative contexts. Working as a safer-sex activist in Manhattan during the late 1990s, David Valentine conducted ethnographic research among mostly male-to-female transgender-identified people at drag balls, support groups, cross-dresser organizations, clinics, bars, and clubs. However, he found that many of those labeled “transgender” by activists did not know the term or resisted its use. Instead, they self-identified as “gay,” a category of sexual rather than gendered identity and one rejected in turn by the activists who claimed these subjects as transgender. Valentine analyzes the reasons for and potential consequences of this difference, and how social theory is implicated in it.  Valentine argues that “transgender” has been adopted so rapidly in the contemporary United States because it clarifies a model of gender and sexuality that has been gaining traction within feminism, psychiatry, and mainstream gay and lesbian politics since the 1970s: a paradigm in which gender and sexuality are distinct arenas of human experience. This distinction and the identity categories based on it erase the experiences of some gender-variant people—particularly poor persons of color—who conceive of gender and sexuality in other terms. While recognizing the important advances transgender has facilitated, Valentine argues that a broad vision of social justice must include, simultaneously, an attentiveness to the politics of language and a recognition of how social theoretical models and broader political economies are embedded in the day-to-day politics of identity.

"title : Object Worlds in Ancient Egypt: Material Biographies Past and Present (Materializing Culture) - author : Lynn Meskellcategory : anthropologydescription : From the Valley of the Kings to Las Vegas, Egypt looms large in the Western imagination. So why are we intrigued by pyramids and practices of mummification? Is it because the ancient Egyptians fetishized material objects? And what do Egyptian remains tell us about biography, embodiment, memory, materiality, the self, and, indeed, ourselves? This book considers how excavated objects reveal ancient Egyptians' experiences of their material world. It also explores existential questions that not only preoccupied ancient Egyptians, but continue to fascinate people today. What is the essence of persons and things? How might we understand the situated experiences of material life? How might objects successfully mediate between worlds? Meskell ultimately moves forward through time and examines the consumption of Egyptian material objects in the contemporary world, including Las Vegas. Meskell provides an elegant analysis of the aesthetics of ancient Egyptian material culture and insights into its mysteries, including our own ongoing fascination.   Read more Read less"

"title : Why sex matters - author : Bobbi S. Lowcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Why are men, like other primate males, usually the aggressors and risk takers? Why do women typically have fewer sexual partners? In Why Sex Matters, Bobbi Low ranges from ancient Rome to modern America, from the Amazon to the Arctic, and from single-celled organisms to international politics, to show that these and many other questions about human behavior largely come down to evolution and sex. More precisely, as she shows in this uniquely comprehensive and accessible survey of behavioral and evolutionary ecology, they come down to the basic principle that all organisms evolved to maximize their reproductive success and seek resources to do so, but that sometimes cooperation and collaboration are the most effective ways to succeed. This newly revised edition has been thoroughly updated to include the latest research and reflect exciting changes in the field, including how our evolutionary past continues to affect our ecological present""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Working Together in Vanuatu - author : Taylor, J.category : anthropologydescription : This collection is derived from a conference held at the Vanuatu National Museum and Cultural Centre (VCC) that brought together a large gathering of foreign and indigenous researchers to discuss diverse perspectives relating to the unique program of social, political and historical research and management that has been fostered in that island nation. While not diminishing the importance of individual or sole-authored methodologies, project-centered collaborative approaches have today become a defining characteristic of Vanuatu’s unique research environment. As this volume attests, this environment has included a dynamically wide range of both ni-Vanuatu and foreign researchers and related research perspectives, most centrally including archaeologists and anthropologists, linguists, historians, legal studies scholars and development practitioners. This emphasis on collaboration has emerged from an ongoing awareness across Vanuatu’s research community of the need for trained researchers to engage directly with pressing social and ethical concerns, and out of the proven fact that it is not just from the outcomes of research that communities or individuals may be empowered, but also through their modes and processes of implementation, as through the ongoing strength and value of the relationships they produce. With this in mind, the papers presented here go beyond the mere celebration of collaboration by demonstrating Vanuatu’s specific environment of cross-cultural research as a diffuse set of historically emergent methodological approaches, and by showing how these work in actual practice.

"title : Man Bac - author : Hirofumi Matsumuracategory : anthropologydescription : The site of Man Bac in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, one of the most meticulously excavated and carefully analysed of Southeast Asian archaeological sites in the past few years, is emerging as a key site in the region. This book carefully analyses the human and animal remains and puts them into context. The authors describe in detail the health status, the unusual demographic profile and the interestingly divergent affinities of the cemetery population, and discuss their meaning, particularly in association with evidence for the use of marine and terrestrial animal resources; they argue convincingly that the site documents a time when the face of the region?s population was undergoing a fundamental shift, associated with a changing economic subsistence base. Physical anthropologists and archaeologists have argued for years over the timeline, the manner and the very nature of Southeast Asian population history, and this book is essential reading in this debate. Two supporting appendices describe the individual remains in detail.   Read more Read less"

"title : Oceanic Explorations - author : Stuart Bedfordcategory : anthropologydescription : Lapita comprises an archaeological horizon that is fundamental to the understanding of human colonisation and settlement of the Pacific as it is associated with the arrival of the common ancestors of the Polynesians and many Austronesian-speaking Melanesians more than 3000 years ago. While Lapita archaeology has captured the imagination and sustained the focus of archaeologists for more than 50 years, more recent discoveries have inspired renewed interpretations and assessments. Oceanic Explorations reports on a number of these latest discoveries and includes papers which reassess the Lapita phenomenon in light of this new data. They reflect on a broad range of interrelated themes including Lapita chronology, patterns of settlement, migration, interaction and exchange, ritual behaviour, sampling strategies and ceramic analyses, all of which relate to aspects highlighting both advances and continuing impediments associated with Lapita research.

"title : Political Transition and Inclusive Development in Malawi - author : Dan Banikcategory : anthropologydescription : Malawi is among the few countries in sub-Saharan Africa that has witnessed significant improvements in relation to meeting the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. It exhibits some of the main challenges facing African democracies while they attempt to consolidate the benefits of democratisation. Political Transition and Inclusive Development in Malawi critically analyses opportunities and constraints related to the impact of democracy on development in one of the world?s poorest countries. The book explores how, and to what extent, processes related to democratic and economic governance can be strengthened in order to make political and administrative authorities more responsive to development needs. It also considers characteristics of successful implementation of public policy and the effective and timely delivery of basic services in local contexts; increased citizen participation and dialogue with local government authorities; factors that enable civil society organisations to hold political and administrative officials to account; and better utilisation of academic research for improved evidence-based policy formulation and implementation. This volume will be of great interest to scholars in development studies, African studies, politics, law and anthropology, as well as policymakers and those interested in democracy, governance, human rights and the implementation of anti-poverty programmes, development administration and decentralisation.

"title : Border crossings: cultural workers and the politics of education - author : Henry A. Girouxcategory : anthropologydescription : Since 1992, Border Crossings  has show cased Henry A. Giroux's extraordinary range as a thinker by bringing together a series of essays that refigure the relationship between post-modernism, feminism, cultural studies and critical pedagogy. With discussions of topics including the struggle over academic canon, the role of popular culture in the curriculum and the cultural war the New Right has waged on schools, Giroux identified the most pressing issues facing critical educators at the turn of the century. In this revised edition, Giroux reflects on the limits and possibilities of border crossings in the 21st century. ""Borders"" in our post 9/11 world have not been collapsing, he argues, but vigorously rebuilt. In order to have a truly critically engaged citizenry the challenges of these new ""borders""- such as the increased militarization of public spaces, the rise of neo-liberalism, and the war in Iraq- must play a vital role in any debate on school and pedagogy.

"title : Cosmic Voyage - author : Courtney Browncategory : anthropologydescription : From Publishers Weekly    Using an admixture of elements from Star Trek, world religions and a psychic technique called scientific remote viewing (SRV) developed by the Pentagon during the Cold War, Emory University political science professor Brown has put together a collection of his SRV sessions in 1993- 1994 and reveals what he learned from them: there was humanoid life on Mars, but that planet became uninhabitable, so a number of Martians escaped to Earth, where some live in subterranean caverns in New Mexico and others in a location in Latin America that the author declines to reveal. Brown writes that replication is a yardstick of the scientific method, but he presents no evidence from other practitioners of SRV who allegedly shared his discoveries. Most surprising, no attempt has been made to establish physical contact with the colonies of Martians supposedly on our planet, leaving the reader to assume they are there only because Brown says so. Despite the publisher's claim that the book ""resolves major questions about extraterrestrials,"" skeptics are apt to be even more skeptical after reading it. Author tour.    Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.

"title : Aspects of Urbanization in China - author : Gregory Brackencategory : anthropologydescription : China's rise is one of the transformative events of our time. Aspects of Urbanization in China: Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangzhou examines some of the aspects of China's massive wave of urbanization - the largest the world has ever seen. The various papers in the book, written by academics from different disciplines, represent ongoing research and exploration and give a useful snapshot in a rapidly developing discourse. Their point of departure is the city - Shanghai, Hong Kong and Guangzhou - where the downside of China's miraculous economic growth is most painfully apparent. And it is concern for the citizens of these cities that unifies the papers in a book whose authors seek to understand what life is like for the people who call them home.   Read more Read less"

"title : Mappae Mundi - author : Johan Goudsblomcategory : anthropologydescription : Never before in history was the interaction between people and their natural environment as complex and problematic as it is today. A proliferation of scientific research has yielded valuable insights into various aspects of this interaction from the angle of many disciplines - the natural sciences, the social sciences, archaeology and history, ecological studies. The diversity of approaches has created a need for synthesis, for a study that transcends the boundaries of traditional fields of study. In this volume, authors from various academic backgrounds discuss the relations between human society and its physical environment in the course of history, highlighting a number of significant periods, throughout the world. The last chapter assesses our present situation and prospects for the future in the light of theoretical reflections based on the evidence from the past.   Read more Read less"
"title : Conviviality at the Crossroads - author : Oscar Hemercategory : anthropologydescription : Conviviality has lately become a catchword not only in academia but also among political activists. This open access book discusses conviviality in relation to the adjoining concepts cosmopolitanism and creolisation. The urgency of today’s global predicament is not only an argument for the revival of all three concepts, but also a reason to bring them into dialogue. Ivan Illich envisioned a post-industrial convivial society of ‘autonomous individuals and primary groups’ (Illich 1973), which resembles present-day manifestations of ‘convivialism’. Paul Gilroy refashioned conviviality as a substitute for cosmopolitanism, denoting an ability to be ‘at ease’ in contexts of diversity (Gilroy 2004). Rather than replacing one concept with the other, the fourteen contributors to this book seek to explore the interconnections – commonalities and differences – between them, suggesting that creolisation is a necessary complement to the already-intertwined concepts of conviviality and cosmopolitanism. Although this volume takes northern Europe as its focus, the contributors take care to put each situation in historical and global contexts in the interests of moving beyond the binary thinking that prevails in terms of methodologies, analytical concepts, and political implementations.

"title : Anthropologies of Education: A Global Guide to Ethnographic Studies of Learning and Schooling - author : Kathryn M. Anderson-Levittcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Despite international congresses and international journals, anthropologies of education differ significantly around the world. Linguistic barriers constrain the flow of ideas, which results in a vast amount of research on educational anthropology that is not published in English or is difficult for international readers to find. This volume responds to the call to attend to educational research outside the United States and to break out of “metropolitan provincialism.” A guide to the anthropologies and ethnographies of learning and schooling published in German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Slavic languages, Japanese, and English as a second language, it shows how scholars in Latin America, Japan, and elsewhere adapt European, American, and other approaches to create new traditions. As the contributors show, educators draw on different foundational research and different theoretical discussions. Thus, this global survey raises new questions and casts a new light on what has become a too-familiar discipline in the United States."" (from the publisher)   Read more Read less"

The Anthropology of Expeditions draws together contributions from anthropologists and historians of science to explore the role of these journeys in natural history and anthropology between approximately 1890 and 1930. By examining collected materials as well as museum and archive records, the contributors to this volume shed light on the complex social life and intimate work practices of the researchers involved in these expeditions. At the same time, the contributors also demonstrate the methodological challenges and rewards of studying these legacies and provide new insights for the history of collecting, history of anthropology, and histories of expeditions. Offering fascinating insights into the nature of expeditions and the human relationships that shaped them, The Anthropology of Expeditions sets a new standard for the field.

"title : Gender diversity in Indonesia - author : Sharyn Graham Daviescategory : anthropologydescription : Indonesia provides particularly interesting examples of gender diversity. Same-sex relations, transvestism and cross-gender behaviour have long been noted amongst a wide range of Indonesian peoples. This book explores the nature of gender diversity in Indonesia, and with the world’s largest Muslim population, it examines Islam in this context. Based on extensive ethnographic research, it discusses in particular calalai – female-born individuals who identify as neither woman nor man; calabai – male-born individuals who also identify as neither man nor woman; and bissu – an order of shamans who embody female and male elements.  The book examines the lives and roles of these variously gendered subjectivities in everyday life, including in low-status and high-status ritual such as wedding ceremonies, fashion parades, cultural festivals, Islamic recitations and shamanistic rituals. The book analyses the place of such subjectivities in relation to theories of gender, gender diversity and sexuality.   Read more Read less"
"title : Remains of the Soviet Past in Estonia - author : Francisco Martinezcategory : anthropologydescription : What happens to legacies that do not find any continuation? In Estonia, a new generation that does not remember the socialist era and is open to global influences has grown up. As a result, the impact of the Soviet memory in people?s conventional values is losing its effective power, opening new opportunities for repair and revaluation of the past.  Francisco Martinez brings together a number of sites of interest to explore the vanquishing of the Soviet legacy in Estonia: the railway bazaar in Tallinn where concepts such as ?market? and ?employment? take on distinctly different meanings from their Western use; Linnahall, a grandiose venue, whose Soviet heritage now poses diffi cult questions of how to present the building?s history; Tallinn?s cityscape, where the social, spatial and temporal co-evolution of the city can be viewed and debated; Narva, a city that marks the border between the Russian Federation, NATO and the European Union, and represents a place of continual negotiation of belonging; and the new Estonian National Museum in Raadi, an area on the outskirts of Tartu, that has been turned into a memory field.

"title : Social Media in Emergent Brazil - author : Juliano Spyercategory : anthropologydescription : Since the popularisation of the internet, low-income Brazilians have received little government support to help them access it. In response, they have largely self-financed their digital migration. Internet cafés became prosperous businesses in working-class neighbourhoods and rural settlements, and, more recently, families have aspired to buy their own home computer with hire purchase agreements. As low-income Brazilians began to access popular social media sites in the mid-2000s, affluent Brazilians ridiculed their limited technological skills, different tastes and poor schooling, but this did not deter them from expanding their online presence. Young people created profiles for barely literate older relatives and taught them to navigate platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp. Based on 15 months of ethnographic research, this book aims to understand why low-income Brazilians have invested so much of their time and money in learning about social media. Juliano Spyer explores this question from a number of perspectives, including education, relationships, work and politics. He argues that social media is the way for low-income Brazilians to stay connected to the family and friends they see in person on a regular basis, which suggests that social media serves a crucial function in strengthening traditional social relations   Read more Read less"
"title : Tales of Gotham, Historical Archaeology, Ethnohistory and Microhistory of New York City - author : Meta F. Janowitzcategory : anthropologydescription : Historical Archaeology and Ethnohistory of New York City: Tales and Microhistory of Gotham is a collection of narratives about people who lived in New York City during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, people whose lives archaeologists have encountered during excavations at sites where these people lived or worked. The stories are ethnohistorical or microhistorical studies created using archaeological and documentary data. As microhistories, they are concerned with particular people living at particular times in the past within the framework of world events.  The world events framework will be provided in short introductions to chapters grouped by time periods and themes. The foreword by Mary Beaudry and the afterword by LuAnne DeCunzo bookend the individual case studies and add theoretical weight to the volume. Topics in the book include:·         Native Americans and Europeans in New Amsterdam ·         Stories of Dutch women in the colonial period·         African history in New York City, including the African Burial Ground·         Craftsmen and Churchmen of New York City·         A portrait of Stephen Allen, a New York City Mayor Historical Archaeology and Ethnohistory of New York City: Tales and Microhistory of Gotham focuses on specific individual life stories, or stories of groups of people, as a way to present archaeological theory and research. Archaeologists work with material culture—artifacts—to recreate daily lives and study how culture works; this book is an example of how to do this in a way that can attract people interested in history as well as in anthropological theory. As such, this volume is an invaluable resource for archaeologists, historians, ethnographers, anthropologists, and anybody interested in the rich history of one of the world’s most influential cities, New York City.

"title : After Love - author : Noelle M. Stoutcategory : anthropologydescription : Focused on the intimate effects of large-scale economic transformations, After Love illuminates the ways that everyday efforts to imagine, resist, and enact market reforms shape sexual desires and subjectivities.  Anthropologist Noelle M. Stout arrived in Havana in 2002 to study the widely publicized emergence of gay tolerance in Cuba but discovered that the sex trade was dominating everyday discussions among gays, lesbians, and travestis. Largely eradicated after the Revolution, sex work, including same-sex prostitution, exploded in Havana when the island was opened to foreign tourism in the early 1990s. The booming sex trade led to unprecedented encounters between Cuban gays and lesbians, and straight male sex workers and foreign tourists.  As many gay Cuban men in their thirties and forties abandoned relationships with other gay men in favor of intimacies with straight male sex workers, these bonds complicated ideas about ""true love"" for queer Cubans at large.  From openly homophobic hustlers having sex with urban gays for room and board, to lesbians disparaging sex workers but initiating relationships with foreign men for money, to gay tourists espousing communist rhetoric while handing out Calvin Klein bikini briefs, the shifting economic terrain raised fundamental questions about the boundaries between labor and love in late-socialist Cuba.

"title : The Identity and the Life of the Church - author : Yosep Kimcategory : anthropologydescription : The study of John Calvin's ecclesiology argues that Calvin's idea of the twofold identity of the Church--its spiritual identity as the body of Christ and its functional identity as the mother of believers--is closely related to his understanding of Christian identity and life, which are initiated and maintained by the grace of the triune God. The anthropological basis of Calvin's idea of the Church has not been examined fully, even though Calvin presents the important concepts of his ecclesiology in light of his anthropological ideas. This study offers an overall evaluation for Calvin's ecclesiology, arguing that it is ultimately his pastoral concern for the Christian and the Church under affliction that both governs his theological understanding of the Church and shapes his proposals for establishing and sustaining the life of the Church in the world.--Back cover.

"title : Social Media in Industrial China - author : Xinyuan Wangcategory : anthropologydescription : Described as the biggest migration in human history, an estimated 250 million Chinese people have left their villages in recent decades to live and work in urban areas. Xinyuan Wang spent 15 months living among a community of these migrants in a small factory town in southeast China to track their use of social media. It was here she witnessed a second migration taking place: a movement from offline to online. As Wang argues, this is not simply a convenient analogy but represents the convergence of two phenomena as profound and consequential as each other, where the online world now provides a home for the migrant workers who feel otherwise ‘homeless’.  Wang’s fascinating study explores the full range of preconceptions commonly held about Chinese people – their relationship with education, with family, with politics, with ‘home’ – and argues why, for this vast population, it is time to reassess what we think we know about contemporary China and the evolving role of social media.

"title : Homophobias - author : David A. B. Murraycategory : anthropologydescription : What is it about “the homosexual” that incites vitriolic rhetoric and violence around the world? How and why do some people hate queers? Does homophobia operate differently across social, political, and economic terrains? What are the ambivalences in homophobic discourses that can be exploited to undermine its hegemonic privilege?  This volume addresses these questions through critical interrogations of sites where homophobic discourses are produced. It provides innovative analytical insights that expose the complex and intersecting cultural, political, and economic forces contributing to the development of new forms of homophobia. And it is a call to action for anthropologists and other social scientists to examine more carefully the politics, histories, and contexts of places and people who profess hatred for queerness.  The contributors to this volume open up the scope of inquiry into processes of homophobia, moving the analysis of a particular form of “hate” into new, wider sociocultural and political fields. The ongoing production of homophobic discourses is carefully analyzed in diverse sites including New York City, Australia, the Caribbean, Greece, India, and Indonesia, as well as American Christian churches, in order to uncover the complex operational processes of homophobias and their intimate relationships to nationalism, sexism, racism, class, and colonialism. The contributors also critically inquire into the limitations of the term homophobia and interrogate its utility as a cross-cultural designation.   Read more Read less"

"title : Mapping Society - author : Laura Vaughancategory : anthropologydescription : From a rare map of yellow fever in eighteenth-century New York, to Charles Booth’s famous maps of poverty in nineteenth-century London, an Italian racial zoning map of early twentieth-century Asmara, to a map of wealth disparities in the banlieues of twenty-first-century Paris, Mapping Society traces the evolution of social cartography over the past two centuries. In this richly illustrated book, Laura Vaughan examines maps of ethnic or religious difference, poverty, and health inequalities, demonstrating how they not only serve as historical records of social enquiry, but also constitute inscriptions of social patterns that have been etched deeply on the surface of cities.  The book covers themes such as the use of visual rhetoric to change public opinion, the evolution of sociology as an academic practice, changing attitudes to physical disorder, and the complexity of segregation as an urban phenomenon. While the focus is on historical maps, the narrative carries the discussion of the spatial dimensions of social cartography forward to the present day, showing how disciplines such as public health, crime science, and urban planning, chart spatial data in their current practice. Containing examples of space syntax analysis alongside full colour maps and photographs, this volume will appeal to all those interested in the long-term forces that shape how people live in cities.

"title : Lifestyle in Siberia and the Russian North - author : Joachim Otto Habeckcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Lifestyle in Siberia and the Russian North breaks new ground by exploring the concept of lifestyle from a distinctly anthropological perspective. Showcasing the collective work of ten experienced scholars in the field, the book goes beyond concepts of tradition that have often been the focus of previous research, to explain how political, economic and technological changes in Russia have created a wide range of new possibilities and constraints in the pursuit of different ways of life.  Each contribution is drawn from meticulous first-hand field research, and the authors engage with theoretical questions such as whether and how the concept of lifestyle can be extended beyond its conventionally urban, Euro-American context and employed in a markedly different setting. Lifestyle in Siberia and the Russian North builds on the contributors’ clear commitment to diversifying the field and providing a novel and intimate insight into this vast and dynamic region.  This book provides inspiring reading for students and teachers of Anthropology, Sociology and Cultural Studies and for anyone interested in Russia and its regions. By providing ethnographic case studies, it is also a useful basis for teaching anthropological methods and concepts, both at graduate and undergraduate level. Rigorous and innovative, it marks an important contribution to the study of Siberia and the Russian North.""   Read more Read less"
"title : Intelligence in nature - author : Jeremy Narbycategory : anthropologydescription : Continuing the journey begun in his acclaimed book The Cosmic Serpent, the noted anthropologist ventures firsthand into both traditional cultures and the most up-todate discoveries of contemporary science to determine nature's secret ways of knowing. Anthropologist Jeremy Narby has altered how we understand the Shamanic cultures and traditions that have undergone a worldwide revival in recent years. Now, in one of his most extraordinary journeys, Narby travels the globe-from the Amazon Basin to the Far East-to probe what traditional healers and pioneering researchers understand about the intelligence present in all forms of life. Intelligence in Nature presents overwhelming illustrative evidence that independent intelligence is not unique to humanity alone. Indeed, bacteria, plants, animals, and other forms of nonhuman life display an uncanny penchant for self-deterministic decisions, patterns, and actions. Narby presents the first in-depth anthropological study of this concept in the West. He not only uncovers a mysterious thread of intelligent behavior within the natural world but also probes the question of what humanity can learn from nature's economy and knowingness in its own search for a saner and more sustainable way of life.

"title : Fake - author : Jackson, Jr, John L.category : anthropologydescription : Fakes, forgery, counterfeits, hoaxes, bullshit, frauds, knock offs?such terms speak, ostensibly, to the inverse of truth or the obverse of authenticity and sincerity. But what does the modern human obsession with fabrications and frauds tell us about ourselves? And what can anthropology tell us about this obsession? This timely book is the product of the first Annual Debate of Anthropological Keywords, a collaborative project between HAU, the American Ethnological Society, and L?Homme, held each year at the American Anthropological Association Meetings. The aim of the debate is reflect critically on keywords and terms that play a pivotal and timely role in discussions of different cultures and societies, and of the relations between them. This book, with multiple authors, explodes open our common sense notions of ?novelty,? ?originality,? and ?truth,? questioning how cultures where deception and mistrust flourish seem to produce effective, albeit opaque, forms of sociality.

"title : Sport and technology - author : Roslyn Kerrcategory : anthropologydescription : How do new technologies come to be used in sport? This book moves beyond the idea of functionality to explore the many other important factors that athletes and sporting bodies consider throughout the process of adoption. Few would question the difficulty of producing an elite athletic performance. The high level of training, combined with intense competition and pressure from media and sponsors, can be challenging for athletes and sporting bodies to negotiate. The book investigates how these factors affect the use of technology in sport, while simultaneously demonstrating the influence of new technologies on sporting practice. Using actor-network theory ? an approach common in studies of science and management but seldom applied in this field ? it offers readers an inside view into elite sport and the part that technology plays in training, competition and broadcasting.

"title : Juvenescence - author : Robert Pogue Harrisoncategory : anthropologydescription : How old are you? The more thought you bring to bear on the question, the harder it is to answer. For we age simultaneously in different ways: biologically, psychologically, socially. And we age within the larger framework of a culture, in the midst of a history that predates us and will outlast us. Looked at through that lens, many aspects of late modernity would suggest that we are older than ever, but Robert Pogue Harrison argues that we are also getting startlingly younger--in looks, mentality, and behavior. We live, he says, in an age of juvenescence. Like all of Robert Pogue Harrison's books, Juvenescence ranges brilliantly across cultures and history, tracing the ways that the spirits of youth and age have inflected each other from antiquity to the present. Drawing on the scientific concept of neotony, or the retention of juvenile characteristics through adulthood, and extending it into the cultural realm, Harrison argues that youth is essential for culture's innovative drive and flashes of genius. At the same time, however, youth--which Harrison sees as more protracted than ever--is a luxury that requires the stability and wisdom of our elders and our institutions.   Read more Read less"
"title : Minds make societies - author : Pascal Boyercategory : anthropologydescription : A watershed book that masterfully integrates insights from evolutionary biology, genetics, psychology, economics, and more to explore the development and workings of human societies ""There is no good reason why human societies should not be described and explained with the same precision and success as the rest of nature."" Thus argues evolutionary psychologist Pascal Boyer in this uniquely innovative book. Integrating recent insights from evolutionary biology, genetics, psychology, economics, and other fields, he offers precise models of why humans engage in social behaviors such as forming families, tribes, and nations, or creating gender roles. In fascinating, thought-provoking passages, he explores questions such as, Why is there conflict between groups? Why do people believe low-value information like rumors? Why are there religions? What is social justice? What explains morality? Boyer provides a new picture of cultural transmission that draws on the pragmatics of human communication, the constructive nature of memory in human brains, and human motivation for group formation and cooperation.

"title : The anthropology of magic - author : Susan Greenwoodcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Magic is arguably the least understood subject in anthropology today. Exotic and fascinating, it offers us a glimpse into another world but it also threatens to undermine the foundations of anthropology due to its supposed irrational and non-scientific nature. Magic has thus often been 'explained away' by social or psychological reduction. The Anthropology of Magic redresses the balance and brings magic, as an aspect of consciousness, into focus through the use of classic texts and cutting-edge research. Suitable for student and scholar alike, The Anthropology of Magic updates a classical anthropological debate concerning the nature of human experience. A key theme is that human beings everywhere have the potential for magical consciousness. Taking a new approach to some perennial topics in anthropology--such as shamanism, mythology, witchcraft, and healing--the book raises crucial theoretical and methodological issues to provide the reader with an engaging and critical understanding of the dynamics of magic""--Provided by publisher.

"title : Agency, contingency and census process - author : Frances Morphycategory : anthropologydescription : The Indigenous Enumeration Strategy (IES) of the Australian National Census of Population and Housing has evolved over the years in response to the perceived ‘difference’ of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Its defining characteristics are the use of locally recruited, mostly Indigenous collector interviewers, and the administration of a modified collection instrument in discrete Indigenous communities, mostly in remote Australia. The research reported here is unique. The authors, with the assistance of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, were able to follow the workings of the IES in the 2006 Census from the design of the collection instrument to the training of temporary census field staff at the Northern Territory’s Census Management Unit in Darwin, to the enumeration in four remote locations, through to the processing stage at the Data Processing Centre in Melbourne. This allowed the tracking of data from collection to processing, and an assessment of the effects of information flows on the quality of the data, both as input and output.  This study of the enumeration involved four very different locations: a group of small outstation communities (Arnhem Land), a large Aboriginal township (Wadeye), an ‘open’ town with a majority Aboriginal population (Fitzroy Crossing), and the minority Aboriginal population of a major regional centre (Alice Springs). A comparison between these contexts reveals differences that reflect the diversity of remote Aboriginal Australia, but also commonalities that exert a powerful influence on the effectiveness of the IES, in particular very high levels of short-term mobility. The selection of sites also allowed a comparison between the enumeration process in the Northern Territory, where a time-extended rolling count was explicitly planned for, and Western Australia, where a modified form of the standard count had been envisaged.  The findings suggest that the IES has reached a point in its development where the injection of ever-increasing resources into essentially the same generic set and structure of activities may be producing diminishing returns. There is a need for a new kind of engagement between the Australian Bureau of Statistics and local government and Indigenous community-sector organisations in remote Australia. The agency and local knowledge of Indigenous people could be harnessed more effectively through an ongoing relationship with such organisations, to better address the complex contingencies confronting the census process in remote Indigenous Australia.

"title : Passionate Histories - author : Frances Peters-Littlecategory : anthropologydescription : This book examines the emotional engagements of both Indigenous and Non-Indigenous people with Indigenous history. The contributors are a mix of Indigenous and Non-Indigenous scholars, who in different ways examine how the past lives on in the present, as myth, memory, and history. Each chapter throws fresh light on an aspect of history-making by or about Indigenous people, such as the extent of massacres on the frontier, the myth of Aboriginal male idleness, the controversy over Flynn of the Inland, the meaning of the Referendum of 1967, and the policy and practice of Indigenous child removal.

"title : First Contacts in Polynesia - author : Serge Tcherkcategory : anthropologydescription : This book explores the first encounters between Samoans and Europeans up to the arrival of the missionaries, using all available sources for the years 1722 to the 1830s, paying special attention to the first encounter on land with the Lapérouse expedition. Many of the sources used are French, and some of difficult accessibility, and thus they have not previously been thoroughly examined by historians. Adding some Polynesian comparisons from beyond Samoa, and reconsidering the so-called ‘Sahlins-Obeyesekere debate’ about the fate of Captain Cook, ‘First Contacts’ in Polynesia advances a hypothesis about the contemporary interpretations made by the Polynesians of the nature of the Europeans, and about the actions that the Polynesians devised for this encounter: wrapping Europeans up in ‘cloth’ and presenting ‘young girls’ for ‘sexual contact’. It also discusses how we can go back two centuries and attempt to reconstitute, even if only partially, the point of view of those who had to discover for themselves these Europeans whom they call ‘Papalagi’. The book also contributes an additional dimension to the much-touted ‘Mead-Freeman debate’ which bears on the rules and values regulating adolescent sexuality in ‘Samoan culture’. Scholars have long considered the pre-missionary times as a period in which freedom in sexuality for adolescents predominated. It appears now that this erroneous view emerged from a deep misinterpretation of Lapérouse’s and Dumont d’Urville’s narratives.   Read more Read less"
"title : I Succeeded Once - author : Marie Hansen Felscategory : anthropologydescription : In ‘I Succeeded Once’ – The Aboriginal Protectorate on the Mornington Peninsula, 1839-1840, Marie Fels makes the work of William Thomas accessible to anthropologists, archaeologists, historians and the descendants of the Aboriginal people he wrote about. More importantly, people who live, work, study, holiday or just have a general interest in the area from Melbourne to Point Nepean can learn about the original inhabitants who walked the land before it was cleared for agriculture and urban development. Of course, development of the Mornington Peninsula is ongoing and this book will help those involved in development or the management of Aboriginal cultural heritage to identify, document and protect Aboriginal places that may not be identifiable through archaeological investigations alone. Marie Fels supplements Thomas’s writings with other contemporary accounts and her exhaustive historical research sheds new light on critical events and the significant places of the Boon Wurrung people. Of particular importance is the critical review of information about the kidnapping of Boon Wurrung people from the Mornington Peninsula.

"title : Law's Anthropology - author : Paul Burkecategory : anthropologydescription : Anthropologists have been appearing as key expert witnesses in native title claims for over 20 years. Until now, however, there has been no theoretically-informed, detailed investigation of how the expert testimony of anthropologists is formed and how it is received by judges. This book examines the structure and habitus of both the field of anthropology and the juridical field and how they have interacted in four cases, including the original hearing in the Mabo case. The analysis of background material has been supplemented by interviews with the key protagonists in each case. This allows the reader a unique, insider’s perspective of the courtroom drama that unfolds in each case. The book asks, given the available ethnographic research, how will the anthropologist reconstruct it in a way that is relevant to the legal doctrine of native title when that doctrine gives a wide leeway for interpretation on the critical questions: what is the relevant grouping, what can be counted as a traditional law and when has there been too much change of tradition? How will such evidence be received by judges who are becoming increasingly sceptical about experts tailoring their evidence to suit the party which called them? This book answers these questions by assuming that there is more at stake here than the mere performance of roles. Rather, there is a complex interaction of distinct social fields each with its own habitus, and individual actors are engaged in an active and constructive agency, however subtle, which the painstaking research for this book uncovers.

"title : The Matrix of Lyric Transformation - author : Zong-qi Caicategory : anthropologydescription : Pentasyllabic poetry has been a focus of critical study since the appearance of the earliest works of Chinese literary criticism in the Six Dynasties period. Throughout the subsequent dynasties, traditional Chinese critics continued to examine pentasyllabic poetry as a leading poetic type and to compile various comprehensive anthologies of it.  The Matrix of Lyric Transformation enriches this tradition, using modern analytical methods to explore issues of self-expression and to trace the early formal, thematic, and generic developments of this poetic form. Beginning with a discussion of the Yüeh-fu and ku-shih genres of the Han period, Cai Zong-qi introdues the analytical framework of modes from Western literary criticism to show how the pentasyllabic poetry changed over time. He argues that changing practices of poetic composition effected a shift from a dramatic mode typical of folk compositions to a narrative mode and finally to lyric and symbolic modes developed in literati circles.

"title : Being Young, Male and Muslim in Luton - author : Ashraf Hoquecategory : anthropologydescription : What is it like to be a young Muslim man in post-7/7 Britain, and what impact do wider political factors have on the multifaceted identities of young Muslim men? Drawn from the author?s ethnographic research of British-born Muslim men in the English town of Luton, Being Young, Male and Muslim in Luton explores the everyday lives of the young men and, in particular, how their identity as Muslims has shaped the way they interact with each other, the local community and the wider world.  Through a study of religious values, the pressures of masculinity, the complexities of family and social life, and attitudes towards work and leisure, Ashraf Hoque argues that young Muslims in Luton are subverting what it means to be ?British? through consciously prioritising and re-articulating self-confessed ?Muslim identities? in novel and dynamic ways that suit their experiences as a post-colonial diaspora. Employing extensive participant observation and rich interview content, Hoque paints a detailed picture of young Muslims living in a town consistently associated in the popular media with terrorist activity and as a hotbed for radicalisation. He challenges widely held assumptions about cultural segregation, gender relations and personal liberty in Muslim communities, and gives voice to an emerging generation of Muslims who view Britain as their home and are very much invested in the long-term future of the country and their permanent place within it.     This short and accessible book will be of interest to students seeking grounding in Islam and Muslim communities in diaspora, and scholars from an array of social science and humanities backgrounds including Anthropology, Sociology of Religion, Political Science, Urban Studies and Cultural Studies.

"title : Loud and proud - author : Hilary Pilkingtoncategory : anthropologydescription : The book uses interviews, informal conversations and extended observation at EDL events to critically reflect on the gap between the movement's public image and activists' own understandings of it. It details how activists construct the EDL, and themselves, as 'not racist, not violent, just no longer silent' inter alia through the exclusion of Muslims as a possible object of racism on the grounds that they are a religiously not racially defined group. In contrast activists perceive themselves to be 'second-class citizens', disadvantaged and discriminated by a 'two-tier' justice system that privileges the rights of 'others'. This failure to recognise themselves as a privileged white majority explains why ostensibly intimidating EDL street demonstrations marked by racist chanting and nationalistic flag waving are understood by activists as standing 'loud and proud'; the only way of 'being heard' in a political system governed by a politics of silencing. Unlike most studies of 'far right' movements, this book focuses not on the EDL as an organisation - its origins, ideology, strategic repertoire and effectiveness - but on the individuals who constitute the movement. Its ethnographic approach challenges stereotypes and allows insight into the emotional as well as political dimension of activism. At the same time, the book recognises and discusses the complex political and ethical issues of conducting close-up social research with 'distasteful' groups.   Read more Read less"

"title : Measuring the Master Race - author : Jon Røyne Kyllingstadcategory : anthropologydescription : ""The notion of a superior ‘Germanic’ or ‘Nordic’ race was a central theme in the ideology of the Nazis. But it was also a commonly accepted idea in the early twentieth century, and an actual scientific concept originating from anthropological research on the physical characteristics of Europeans. The Scandinavian Peninsula was considered to be the historical cradle and the core area of this ‘master race’. This book investigates the role played by Scandinavian scholars in inventing this so-called superior race, and discusses how this concept put its stamp on Norwegian physical anthropology, prehistory, national identity, and on the Norwegian eugenics movement. It also explores the decline and scientific disputation of these ideas in the 1930s as they came to be associated with the ‘genetic cleansing’ of Nazi Germany.    This is the first comprehensive study on Norwegian physical anthropology, and its findings shed new light on current political and scientific debates about race across the globe.""

"title : The autonomous life? - author : Nazima Kadircategory : anthropologydescription : This book is an ethnographic study of the internal dynamics of a subcultural community that defines itself as a social movement. While the majority of scholarly studies on this movement focus on its official face, on its front stage, this book concerns itself with the ideological and practical paradoxes at work within the micro-social dynamics of the backstage, an area that has so far been neglected in social movement studies. The central question is how hierarchy and authority function in a social movement subculture that disavows such concepts. The squatters? movement, which defines itself primarily as anti-hierarchical and anti-authoritarian, is profoundly structured by the unresolved and perpetual contradiction between both public disavowal and simultaneous maintenance of hierarchy and authority within the movement. This study analyzes how this contradiction is then reproduced in different micro-social interactions, examining the methods by which people negotiate minute details of their daily lives as squatter activists in the face of a funhouse mirror of ideological expectations reflecting values from within the squatter community, that, in turn, often refract mainstream, middle class norms.

"title : Subjects of modernity - author : Saurabh Dubecategory : anthropologydescription : This book thinks through modernity and its representations by exploring critical considerations of time and space. Drawing on anthropology, history and social theory, it investigates the oppositions and enchantments, the contradictions and contentions, and the identities and ambivalences spawned under modernity. Crucially, it understands these antinomies not as errors, but as constitutive elements of modern worlds. The book questions routine portrayals of homogeneous time and antinomian blueprints of cultural space, while acknowledging the production of time and space by social subjects. Instead of assuming a straightforward, singular trajectory for the phenomena, it views modernity as involving checkered, contingent and contended processes of meaning and power, which have found heterogeneous historical elaborations over the past five centuries. Bringing together past and present, theory and narrative, it sows the historical, ethnographic and methodological deep into its critical procedures, offering an innovative understanding of cultural identities and imaginatively exploring the relationship between history and anthropology.

"title : The Insecure City - author : Kristin V. Monroecategory : anthropologydescription : Urban anthropologist Kristin Monroe takes urban anthropology in a new and meaningful direction?the story of traffic in the Middle East, focusing on Beirut. As bombs reappeared recently following an impasse between competing political groups and their international backers, residents of the city were forced to contend with many forms of insecurity, forging their lives amid a contentious, often violent, political and economic landscape. Images and headlines in the news media tracked the dramatic events that characterized this unstable situation, but they did not provide a picture of what ordinary life was like for urban dwellers in a city terrorized by political sectarianism and the treat of bombs. The Insecure City is an ethnographic exploration of the experiences of moving through Beirut. Driving is characterized by precariousness, the anticipation of violence, and the constant presence of class, political, and state power.   Read more Read less"
"title : Realizing the Witch - author : Richard Baxstromcategory : anthropologydescription : Benjamin Christensen?s Häxan (The Witch, 1922) stands as a singular film within the history of cinema. Deftly weaving contemporary scientific analysis and powerfully staged historical scenes of satanic initiation, confession under torture, possession, and persecution, Häxan creatively blends spectacle and argument to provoke a humanist re-evaluation of witchcraft in European history as well as the contemporary treatment of female ?hysterics? and the mentally ill. In Realizing the Witch, Baxstrom and Meyers show how Häxan opens a window onto wider debates in the 1920s regarding the relationship of film to scientific evidence, the evolving study of religion from historical and anthropological perspectives, and the complex relations between popular culture, artistic expression, and concepts in medicine and psychology. Häxan is a film that travels along the winding path of art and science rather than between the narrow division of ?documentary? and ?fiction.?   Read more Read less"

"title : Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race - author : Michael A. Cremocategory : anthropologydescription : Over the centuries, researchers have found bones and artifacts proving that humans like us have existed for millions of years. Mainstream science, however, has suppressed these facts. Prejudices based on current scientific theory act as a 'knowledge filter', giving us a picture of prehistory that is largely incorrect.  Scientific Establishment Found Guilty of Witholding Evidence    The evolutionists’ “knowledge filter” at work over the last 200 years has left us with a radically altered view of our human origins and antiquity. Since 1993, when the controversial book, Forbidden    Archeology, was first published it has shocked the scientific world with its extensive evidence for extreme human antiquity. It documents hundreds of anomalies in the archeological record that    contradict the prevailing theory and shows how this massive amount of evidence was systematically “filtered” out. This book puts all the “pieces” on the table. You can then judge for yourself how objective the scientific community is in its pursuit of knowledge!  “Forbidden Archeology is a remarkably complete review of the scientific evidence concerning human origins. It carefully evaluates all the evidence, including the evidence that has been ignored because it does not fit the dominant paradigm. Anyone can learn a great deal from the authors’ meticulous research and analysis, whatever one concludes about their thesis regarding the antiquity of human beings.”    —Dr. Phillip E. Johnson, University of California, Berkeley, author of Darwin on Trial  “I perceive in Forbidden Archeology an important work of thoroughgoing scholarship and intellectual adventure. Forbidden Archeology ascends and descends into the realms of the human construction of scientific ‘fact’ and theory: postmodern territories that historians, philosophers, and sociologists of scientific knowledge are investigating with increasing frequency. . . .    With exacting research into the history of paleoanthropological discovery, Cremo and Thompson zoom in on the epistemological crisis of the human fossil record, the process of disciplinary    suppression, and the situated scientific handling of ‘anomalous evidence’ to build persuasive theory and local institutions of knowledge and power.”    —Dr. Pierce J. Flynn, Department of Arts and Science, California State University, San Marcos  “Forbidden Archeology, written primarily for the layman, provides a critical review of evidence relevant to human evolution. In addition, the book will serve as a valuable resource of forgotten literature, which is usually not easily accessible. If it stimulates professional reinvestigation of reports not fitting the current paradigm on human evolution, Forbidden Archeology will have contributed    to the advancement of knowledge of the history of mankind.”    —Dr. Siegfried Scherer, Institute for Microbiology, Technical Universtiy of Munich, Germany  “One of the landmark intellectual achievements of the late 20th century…Sooner or later, whether we like it or not, our species is going to have to come to terms with the facts that are so impressively documented…and these facts are stunning.”    —Graham Hancock, author, Fingerprints of the Gods   Read more Read less"

"title : La violenza tra tradizione e digital society - author : Alessandra Sannellacategory : anthropologydescription : ""The text explores the phenomenon of violence, retracing the sociological theory from the classical paradigms to the frontier of interpretative readings outlined in the digital society age. The aim is to arrive at an interpretation on violence and the possible connections that go from traditional society, in the historiographic sense of action, to the challenges proposed by contemporary society. What is the form that violence takes today? Which are the indicators that allow you to recognize it? Following these reflections, this book raises the question about the social nature of violence in the many forms in which it manifests itself. The analysis that is proposed is therefore that of seeking the widespread dimensions within which the contemporary individual acts, as well as identifying the indicators that, through functional categories, can prevent and combat violence.""

"title : An Anthropology of Landscape - author : Christopher Tilleycategory : anthropologydescription : An Anthropology of Landscape tells the fascinating story of a heathland landscape in south-west England and the way different individuals and groups engage with it. Based on a long-term anthropological study, the book emphasises four individual themes: embodied identities, the landscape as a sensuous material form that is acted upon and in turn acts on people, the landscape as contested, and its relation to emotion. The landscape is discussed in relation to these themes as both ?taskscape? and ?leisurescape?, and from the perspective of different user groups. First, those who manage the landscape and use it for work: conservationists, environmentalists, archaeologists, the Royal Marines, and quarrying interests. Second, those who use it in their leisure time: cyclists and horse riders, model aircraft flyers, walkers, people who fish there, and artists who are inspired by it. The book makes an innovative contribution to landscape studies and will appeal to all those interested in nature conservation, historic preservation, the politics of nature, the politics of identity, and an anthropology of Britain.

"title : Social Media in Rural China - author : Tom McDonaldcategory : anthropologydescription : China’s distinctive social media platforms have gained notable popularity among the nation’s vast number of internet users, but has China’s countryside been ‘left behind’ in this communication revolution?  Tom McDonald spent 15 months living in a small rural Chinese community researching how the residents use social media in their daily lives. His ethnographic findings suggest that, far from being left behind, social media is already deeply integrated into the everyday experience of many rural Chinese people.  Throughout his ground-breaking study, McDonald argues that social media allows rural people to extend and transform their social relationships by deepening already existing connections with friends known through their school, work or village, while also experimenting with completely new forms of relationships through online interactions with strangers. By juxtaposing these seemingly opposed relations, rural social media users are able to use these technologies to understand, capitalise on and challenge the notions of morality that underlie rural life.

"title : The Origins of Self - author : Martin P. J. Edwardescategory : anthropologydescription : The Origins of Self explores the role that selfhood plays in defining human society, and each human individual in that society. It considers the genetic and cultural origins of self, the role that self plays in socialisation and language, and the types of self we generate in our individual journeys to and through adulthood.  Edwardes argues that other awareness is a relatively early evolutionary development, present throughout the primate clade and perhaps beyond, but self-awareness is a product of the sharing of social models, something only humans appear to do. The self of which we are aware is not something innate within us, it is a model of our self produced as a response to the models of us offered to us by other people. Edwardes proposes that human construction of selfhood involves seven different types of self. All but one of them are internally generated models, and the only non-model, the actual self, is completely hidden from conscious awareness. We rely on others to tell us about our self, and even to let us know we are a self.   Read more Read less"

Who in her household or among her father's Shabbat guests stole the scrolls containing the Alchemical League's valuable formulas? Perhaps the thief was even her frantic father, on the cusp of financial ruin, eager for Miriam to end her dalliance with a handsome jeweler and marry into an honorable and wealthy family. Or her rebellious brother, intent on raising money to travel to Capua so he can enroll in the Roman Empire's most renowned gladiator school. Or her faint-hearted fiance, who begrudges her preoccupation with alchemy and yearns for their forthcoming marriage. (Miriam is based on the true personage of Maria Hebrea, the legendary founder of Western alchemy, who developed the concepts and apparatus alchemists and chemists would use for 1500 years.

Includes carefully selected chapters from the Earth Chronicles series as well as never-before-published letters, articles, and lectures. Each piece includes an introduction, offering context and insight into Sitchin's passionate work and revealing the man behind the theories. Explains the genesis of The 12th Planet, the Anunnaki influences on the Sumerian civilization, the orbit of Nibiru, the prehistory of the Americas, the extraterrestrial origins of modern man, and much more. What if the tales from the Old Testament and other ancient writings, such as those from Sumer, Babylon, Egypt, and Greece, were not myths or allegory but accounts of actual historical events? Known for his ability to read and interpret ancient Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets, Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) took the words of our most ancient ancestors as fact and, through decades of meticulous research, showed that they revealed a coherent narrative about the true origins of humanity and civilization. Drawing both widespread interest and criticism, his Earth Chronicles series of books, beginning with The 12th Planet, detailed how humanity arose after the arrival of the Anunnaki ('those who from Heaven to Earth came'), alien 'gods' who created modern man in their own image and imparted gifts of civilizing knowledge. Providing an insider's look into the decades of research behind Zecharia Sitchin's complete works as well as an in-depth overview of his theories, this collection includes carefully selected chapters from the Earth Chronicles series as well as never-before-published letters, articles, and lectures. We learn about the genesis of The 12th Planet in 'The Book as a Story,' the Sumerians and their Anunnaki influences in 'The Sudden Civilization,' the orbit of Nibiru in 'UFOs, Pyramids, and the 12th Planet,' the prehistory of the Americas in 'Cities Lost and Found,' the extraterrestrial origins of modern man in 'The Cosmic Connection--DNA,' and much more. We get to read never-before-published lectures, culled from Sitchin's decades of presentations, as well as the article that spurred the writing of There Were Giants Upon the Earth. Each piece includes an introduction by Sitchin's niece, offering context and insight into Sitchin's passionate work. These introductions reveal the man behind the theories, a world traveler known for his scholarship, dry humor, and precisely chosen words. If his theories are true, as Sitchin wholeheartedly believed, then this collection presents some of the most important knowledge we have of our origins and future""--   Read more Read less"

Was there a race of giants that once inhabited the Americas? Did ancient Egypt and ancient China have heretofore undiscovered ties? Lost Secrets of the Gods delves into these ancient mysteries and many more in articles by some of the world's most intrepid and knowledgeable researchers. The old paradigms of history are being radically transformed as we discover more evidence of little-known cultures and what they achieved. Many ancient cultures spoke and wrote of visitors that gave them knowledge and helped shape their societies. Who were they, and where did they come from? We now know that many ancient cultures had advanced knowledge of science, agriculture, and astronomy, only some of which has been rediscovered in the last 100 years. Were The Iliad and The Odyssey really about an epic struggle in pre-Celtic Europe? What happened to the Persian army that completely disappeared from Egypt 2,500 years ago? Did the ancients know how to create psychic guard dogs to protect sacred sites? There is much more to history than what has officially been recorded.

The focus is on the antithesis between East and West between the 6th and 2nd centuries BC. Various aspects of culture, religion, science, worldview, economics, architecture and lifestyle are made with a view of this opposition to each other. Archaeologists, historians and philologists in the fields of Ancient Near East and Ancient Greece consider parallel each one of these sectors to make similarities and differences between them recognizable. Through this balanced and flexible dialogue to the dominance of the Western perspective and the monolithic character of the derived concept 'Orient' are versus 'Western world' broken and overcome without the active historical power of these concepts would be negated.

Curriercategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : ""Human life has been repeatedly transformed by certain key technologies, each of which has triggered a profound metamorphosis. The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter transformed the human body, enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa into temperate climates. Symbolic communication changed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process. Food production transformed the relationship between humanity and the environment, and with technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery, developed to build accurate clocks, spawned the industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, the rise of digital technologies may well lead to the birth of a global civilization. Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils. But the same forces that allowed us to integrate technology into every aspect of our daily lives have also brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe. Unbound explains both how we got here and how human society must be transformed again to achieve a sustainable future.""--  ""Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils.

"title : Cultural memory and early civilization - author : Jan Assmanncategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : ""Now available to an English-speaking audience, this book presents a groundbreaking theoretical analysis of memory, identity, and culture. It investigates how cultures remember, arguing that human memory exists and is communicated in two ways, namely inter-human interaction and in external systems of notation, such as writing, which can span generations. Dr. Assmann defines two theoretical concepts of cultural memory, differentiating between the long-term memory of societies, which can span up to 3,000 years, and communicative memory, which is typically restricted to 80-100 years. He applies this theoretical framework to case studies of four specific cultures, illustrating the function contexts and specific achievements, including the state, international law, religion, and science. Ultimately, his research demonstrates that memory is not simply a means of retaining information, but rather a force that can shape cultural identity and allow cultures to respond creatively to both daily challenges and catastrophic changes""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Quest for honour - author : Sam Baronecategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : The Bronze Age is brought vividly to life in this action-packed historical saga in the tradition of Conn Iggulden, Bernard Cornwell, and Jean Auel The beginning of civilization is fraught with war, invasion, plunder, and rapine. The little city state of Akkad is carving out a mini-Empire on the banks of the mighty Tigris river-prosperity has returned after the bloody pitched battles waged by Akkad's ruler Eskkar and his beautiful wife Trella. But now comes Akkad's greatest threat from the south: Akkad's rival Sumer, a port city at the hub of the great sea trade routes. Sumer is poised to give birth to the mightiest empire in history. It is ruled by an incestuous parricide and his power-hungry sister who are determined to crush and enslave the nation state on their northern borders. Esskar and Trella must prepare their fledgling nation for total war before it is too late. This time it will be a battle not of villages or of roving warrior bands, but a battle for Empire and a fight to the death. As ever Eskkar, the ultimate warrior and battle tactician, must pit his wits against a vastly superior force in a battle to the death.   Read more Read less"

"title : The Lost History of Western Civilization - author : Stanley Kurtzcategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : The Lost History of Western Civilization finds the secret of America’s polarized politics in the campus culture wars that kicked off at Stanford over thirty years ago. Ever since the Stanford clash, American scholars have claimed that Western Civilization was a myth created by the government during World War I to trick American soldiers into fighting and dying in Europe. The report draws on a deep refutation of this landmark “deconstructionist” claim to develop a new way of looking at the battle between multiculturalism and traditional American conceptions of citizenship. The report explains the link between the relativist skepticism of academics and the moral certainties driving constant accusations of racism and bigotry on campus and beyond. By unearthing the work of great but long-forgotten historians who taught generations of Americans about Western Civilization, the report also casts a new light on the meaning of American exceptionalism. The follies and limitations of deconstructionist, multiculturalist, postmodern, and intersectional thinking are exposed throughout this report. Yet the report also points to a way out. Western civilization is real, not invented, and has never truly disappeared. American college students are deeply a part of Western Civilization, minorities very much included. Recovering, restoring, and teaching the great books and the lost history of Western Civilization still has the potential to unite a divided nation.

"title : The Genius of Ancient Man - author : Don Landiscategory : ancient_civilizationdescription : Evidences and commonalities explored from ancient man around the globe! Why structures echoing the Tower of Babel have been recreated on almost every continent and major culture; What artifacts and archaeology, technology and innovation, really reveal about the origin of mankind; Why many biblical symbols (rainbows, human sacrifice, mountains, the Son/ sun worship) were, and continue to be, distorted in pagan religious practices; What the historical record reveals about Satan's ""counterfeit"" of God's plan for humanity. All over the world there are similar findings of ancient religions, cities and towers, world travel, advanced astronomy, and civilized government. Over the course of two years, a team of researchers from Jackson Hole Bible College has worked to bring together the different pieces of the convoluted mystery and history of ancient man. Hours of researching, trips to various sites around North and Central America, visits to museums, and meetings with experts have provided the team with an overwhelming amount of evidence for the intelligence of these early innovators. A jumble of anomalies and magnificent structures continue to confound archaeology and anthropology today, yet as the dots are connected, one finds history as described in the biblical record. - Publisher.

Bestseller del New York Times con 1 millón de ejemplares vendidos Yuval Noah Harari, autor de Sapiens, un fenómeno internacional unánimemente aclamado por la crítica, regresa con una secuela igualmente original, convincente y provocadora, centrando su atención en el futuro de la humanidad y en nuestra obsesión por convertirnos en dioses. A lo largo del último siglo, la humanidad ha logrado lo imposible frenando la hambruna, la peste y la guerra. Por primera vez en la historia, más personas mueren por obesidad que por pasar hambre y hay más probabilidades de quitarse la vida que de morir en un conflicto bélico o un atentado terrorista. ¿Qué pasará con la democracia cuando Google y Facebook lleguen a conocer nuestros gustos y preferencias políticas mejor que nos conocemos a nosotros mismos? ¿Qué pasará con el estado de bienestar cuando la inteligencia artificial expulse a los individuos del mercado laboral, creando una «clase innecesaria» de humanos? ¿Cómo podremos lidiar con los avances en ingeniería genética? ¿Terminará Silicon Valley por establecer nuevas religiones en lugar de enfocarse a producir únicamente dispositivos inteligentes? Homo Deus explora los proyectos, los sueños y las pesadillas que configurarán el siglo XXI: desde superar la muerte hasta la creación de la inteligencia y la vida artificial. ¿Hacia dónde nos dirigimos? ¿Cómo protegeremos al mundo de nuestros propios poderes destructivos? He aquí una mirada hacia el futuro de la evolución. He aquí Homo Deus.

"title : The aristos: a self-portrait in ideas. - author : John Fowlescategory : anthropologydescription : This book was first published against the advice of almost everyone who read it. I was told that it would do my ‘image’ no good; and I am sure that my belief that a favourable ‘image’ is conceivably not of any great human – or literary – significance would have counted for very little if I had not had a best-selling novel behind me. I used that ‘success’ to issue this ‘failure’, and so I face a charge of unscrupulous obstinacy. To the obstinacy I must plead guilty, but not to lack of scruple; for I was acting only in accordance with what I had written.    My chief concern, in The Aristos is to preserve the freedom of the individual against all those pressures-to-conform that threaten our century; one of those pressures, put upon all of us, but particularly on anyone who comes into public notice, is that of labelling a person by what he gets money and fame for – by what other people most want to use him as. To call a man a plumber is to describe one aspect of him, but it is also to obscure a number of others. I am a writer; I want no more specific prison than that I express myself in printed words. So a prime personal reason for this book was to announce that I did not intend to walk into the cage labelled ‘novelist’.    Aristos is taken from the ancient Greek. It is singular and means roughly ‘the best for a given situation’.

Fromm stresses Marx's humanist philosophy and challenges both contemporary Western ignorance of Marx and Soviet corruptions of his work.

"title : 21 Lessons for the 21st Century - author : Yuval Noah Hararicategory : anthropologydescription : In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power. Censorship works not by blocking the flow of information, but rather by flooding people with disinformation and distractions. 21 Lessons for the 21st Century cuts through these muddy waters and confronts some of the most urgent questions on today’s global agenda.  Why is liberal democracy in crisis? Is God back? Is a new world war coming? What does the rise of Donald Trump signify? What can we do about the epidemic of fake news? Which civilisation dominates the world – the West, China, Islam? Should Europe keep its doors open to immigrants? Can nationalism solve the problems of inequality and climate change? What should we do about terrorism? What should we teach our kids?  Billions of us can hardly afford the luxury of investigating these questions, because we have more pressing things to do: we have to go to work, take care of the kids, or look after elderly parents. Unfortunately, history makes no concessions. If the future of humanity is decided in your absence, because you are too busy feeding and clothing your kids – you and they will not be exempt from the consequences. This is very unfair; but who said history was fair?  A book doesn’t give people food or clothes – but it can offer some clarity, thereby helping to level the global playing field. If this book empowers even a handful of people to join the debate about the future of our species, it has done its job.   After Sapiens looked deep into humankind’s past and Homo Deus considered our existence in a future powered by intelligent design, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century stops to focus on the biggest questions of the present moment. What is really happening right now? What are today’s greatest challenges and choices? What should we pay attention to?  21 Lessons builds on the ideas explored in the previous two books to take the pulse of our current global climate. It untangles political, technological, social, and existential questions, and highlights how they impact the everyday lives of humans worldwide. By presenting complex contemporary challenges clearly and accessibly, the book invites the reader to consider values, meaning and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty.

"title : Keywords - author : Raymond Williamscategory : anthropologydescription : Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society is a book by the Welsh Marxist academic Raymond Williams published in 1976 by Croom Helm.  Originally intended to be published along with the author's 1958 work Culture and Society, this work examines the history of more than a hundred words that are familiar and yet confusing: Art, Bureaucracy, Culture, Educated, Management, Masses, Nature, Originality, Radical, Society, Welfare, Work, and many others.  The approach is cultural rather than etymological. Sometimes the origins of a word cast light on its meaning, but often one finds that it originally meant something quite different. Or that there has been a fierce political struggle over the 'correct' meaning.  A revised and expanded edition of Keywords was published by Fontana in 1983. In 2005 Blackwell published New Keywords: A Revised Vocabulary of Culture and Society, an attempt to update Williams' text.   Read more Read less"

"title : Sources of Chinese tradition - author : Wm. Theodore de Barycategory : anthropologydescription : A collection of seminal primary readings on the social, intellectual, and religious traditions of China, Sources of Chinese Tradition, Volume 1 has been widely used and praised for almost forty years as an authoritative resource for scholars and students and as a thorough and engaging introduction for general readers. Here at last is a completely revised and expanded edition of this classic sourcebook, compiled by noted China scholars Wm. Theodore de Bary and Irene Bloom. Updated to reflect recent scholarly developments, with extensive material on popular thought and religion, social roles, and women's education, this edition features new translations of more than half the works from the first edition, as well as many new selections.  Arranged chronologically, this anthology is divided into four parts, beginning at the dawn of literate Chinese civilization with the Oracle-Bone inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty (1571–1045 B.C.E.) and continuing through the end of the Ming dynasty (C.E. 1644). Each chapter has an introduction that provides useful historical context and offers interpretive strategies for understanding the readings.  The first part, The Chinese Tradition in Antiquity, considers the early development of Chinese civilization and includes selections from Confucius's Analects, the texts of Mencius and Laozi, as well as other key texts from the Confucian, Daoist, and Legalist schools. Part 2, The Making of a Classical Culture, focuses on Han China with readings from the Classic of Changes (I Jing), the Classic of Filiality, major Han syntheses, and the great historians of the Han dynasty. The development of Buddhism, from the earliest translations from Sanskrit to the central texts of the Chan school (which became Zen in Japan), is the subject of the third section of the book. Titled Later Daoism and Mahayana Buddhism in China, this part also covers the teachings of Wang Bi, Daoist religion, and texts of the major schools of Buddhist doctrine and practice. The final part, The Confucian Revival and Neo-Confucianism, details the revival of Confucian thought in the Tang, Song, and Ming periods, with historical documents that link philosophical thought to political, social, and educational developments in late imperial China.  With annotations, a detailed chronology, glossary, and a new introduction by the editors, Sources of Chinese Tradition will continue to be a standard resource, guidebook, and introduction to Chinese civilization well into the twenty-first century.—Publisher   Read more Read less"

Through an engaging examination of issues such as these, and using non-technical language, Reflections of Our Past shows how anthropologists use genetic information to test theories and define possible answers to fundamental questions in human history. By looking at genetic variation in the world today, we can reconstruct the recent and remote events and processes that created the variation we see, providing a fascinating reflection of our genetic past.

Were women to fail in this task, all hope    for the future of humanity would depart from the world"".(p. 250)    ""I consider the theme of this book to be a most important one, for I am convinced, and I    hope the reader will agree, that good relations between the sexes are basic to the    development of good human relations in all societies"" (p. 238.)    ""Women are the bearers, the nurtures of life; men have more often tended to be the    curtailers, the destroyers of life."" (p. 241).    ""Women must be granted complete equality with men, for only when this has been    done will they fully be able to realize themselves"" (p. 242).    ""All human beings should enjoy the rights that are theirs by virtue of their being human,    and not one iota of their rights should ever be abridged on the ground of sex; but to    secure them women will have to labor hard. It cannot be too often repeated that they    will have to do most of the work themselves in improving their status. Getting laws    passed will not be enough; the long hard pull will be to achieve full recognition and    acceptance of their abilities in all phases of national and international life."" (p. 243).    ""Human societies must be based on human relations first, and economic activities    must be a function of human relations--not the other way round"" (p. 243).    ""The sexes should not compete; they should cooperate and complement each other"".    (p. 245).    ""Women are the mothers of humanity; do not let us ever forget that or underemphasize    its importance. What mothers are to their children, so will man be to man"" (pp. 247-    248)    ""Women are the carriers of the true spirit of humanity--the love of the mother for her    child. The preservation of that kind of love is the true function of women. And let me, at    this point, endeavor to make it quite clear why I mean the love of a mother for her child    and not the love of an equal for an equal or any other kind of love"" (p. 248).

"title : Good to eat - author : Marvin Harriscategory : anthropologydescription : Why are human food habits so diverse? Why do Americans recoil at the thought of dog meat? Jews and Moslems, pork? Hindus, beef? Why do Asians abhor milk? In Good to Eat, bestselling author Marvin Harris leads readers on an informative detective adventure to solve the world's major food puzzles. He explains the diversity of the world's gastronomic customs, demonstrating that what appear at first glance to be irrational food tastes turn out really to have been shaped by practical, or economic, or political necessity. In addition, his smart and spirited treatment sheds wisdom on such topics as why there has been an explosion in fast food, why history indicates that it's ""bad"" to eat people but ""good"" to kill them, and why children universally reject spinach. Good to Eat is more than an intellectual adventure in food for thought. It is a highly readable, scientifically accurate, and fascinating work that demystifies the causes of myriad human cultural differences.   Read more Read less"

Originally published in 1914, this text explores the role that intermediate types played amongst early civilisations as well as in religion and military situations. Whilst later civilisations tended to look down on those who did not fit into traditional gender roles, some early peoples saw intermediate types as important figures in their social organisation.

"title : Beyond the Body Farm - author : William M. Basscategory : anthropologydescription : There is no scientist in the world like Dr. Bill Bass. A pioneer in forensic anthropology, Bass created the world's first laboratory dedicated to the study of human decomposition—three acres of land on a hillside in Tennessee where human bodies are left to the elements. His research at ""the Body Farm"" has revolutionized forensic science, helping police crack cold cases and pinpoint time of death. But during a forensics career that spans half a century, Bass and his work have ranged far beyond the gates of the Body Farm. In this riveting book, the bone sleuth explores the rise of modern forensic science, using fascinating cases from his career to take readers into the real world of C.S.I. Some of Bill Bass's cases rely on the simplest of tools and techniques, such as reassembling—from battered torsos and a stack of severed limbs—eleven people hurled skyward by an explosion at an illegal fireworks factory. Other cases hinge on sophisticated techniques Bass could not have imagined when he began his career: harnessing scanning electron microscopy to detect trace elements in knife wounds; and extracting DNA from a long-buried corpse, only to find that the female murder victim may have been mistakenly identified a quarter-century before. In Beyond the Body Farm, readers will follow Bass as he explores the depths of an East Tennessee lake with a twenty-first-century sonar system, in a quest for an airplane that disappeared with two people on board thirty-five years ago; see Bass exhume fifties pop star ""the Big Bopper"" to determine what injuries he suffered in the plane crash that killed three rock and roll legends on ""the day the music died""; and join Bass as he works to decipher an ancient Persian death scene nearly three thousand years old. Witty and engaging, Bass dissects the methods used by homicide investigators every day, leading readers on an extraordinary journey into the high-tech science that it takes to crack a case.

"title : The Navaho - author : Clyde Kluckhohncategory : anthropologydescription : What are the Navaho today? How do they live together and with other races? What is their philosophy of life? Both the general reader and the student will look to this authoritative study for the answers to such questions. The authors review Navaho history from archaeological times to the present, and then present Navaho life today. They show the people's problems in coping with their physical environment; their social life among their own people; their contacts with whites and other Indians and especially with the Government; their economy; their religious beliefs and practices; their language and the problems this raises in their education and their relationships to whites; and their explicit and implicit philosophy.  This book presents not only a study of Navaho life, however: it is an impartial discussion of an interesting experiment in Government administration of a dependent people, a discussion which is significant for contemporary problems of a wider scope; colonial questions; the whole issue of the contact of different races and peoples. It will appeal to every one interested in the Indians, in the Southwest, in anthropology, in sociology, and to many general readers.  This work forms the most thorough-going study ever made of the Navaho Indians, and perhaps of any Indian group. The book was written as a part of the Indian Education Research project undertaken jointly by the Committee on Human Development of the University of Chicago and the United States Office of Indian Affairs. The cooperation of a psychiatrist and anthropologist both in the research for, and in the writing of, this study is noteworthy--as is the fusion of methods and points of view derived from medicine, psychology, and anthropology.

"title : The American Culture of War - author : Adrian R. Lewiscategory : anthropologydescription : The American Culture of War presents a sweeping critical examination of every major American war since 1941: the Second World War, Korea, Vietnam, and the First and Second Persian Gulf Wars. As he carefully considers the cultural forces that surrounded each military engagement, Adrian Lewis offers an original and provocative look at the motives people and governments used to wage war, the discord among military personnel, the flawed political policies that guided military strategy, and the civilian perceptions that characterized each conflict. With each chapter similarly structured to allow the reader to draw parallels between the wars, Lewis deftly traces the evolution of US military strategy since the Second World War.

Of per­sonal oblig­a­tions there are many. All of my as­so­ci­ates in the Mu­seum have been most help­ful: par­tic­u­larly, ac­knowl­edg­ment should be made to Doc­tor Robert H.

"title : Your inner fish - author : Neil Shubincategory : anthropologydescription : Why do we look the way we do?  What does the human hand have in common with the wing of a fly?  Are breasts, sweat glands, and scales connected in some way?  To better understand the inner workings of our bodies and to trace the origins of many of today's most common diseases, we have to turn to unexpected sources: worms, flies, and even fish.Neil Shubin, a leading paleontologist and professor of anatomy who discovered Tiktaalik--the ""missing link"" that made headlines around the world in April 2006--tells the story of evolution by tracing the organs of the human body back millions of years, long before the first creatures walked the earth.  By examining fossils and DNA, Shubin shows us that our hands actually resemble fish fins, our head is organized like that of a long-extinct jawless fish, and major parts of our genome look and function like those of worms and bacteria.Shubin makes us see ourselves and our world in a completely new light.  Your Inner Fish is science writing at its finest--enlightening, accessible, and told with irresistible enthusiasm.From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less"
"title : Abraham's Children - author : Jon Entinecategory : anthropologydescription : Could our sense of who we are really turn on a sliver of DNA? In our multiethnic world, questions of individual identity are becoming increasingly unclear. Now in ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN bestselling author Jon Entine vividly brings to life the profound human implications of the Age of Genetics while illuminating one of today's most controversial topics: the connection between genetics and who we are, and specifically the question ""Who is a Jew?""Entine weaves a fascinating narrative, using breakthroughs in genetic genealogy to reconstruct the Jewish biblical tradition of the chosen people and the hereditary Israelite priestly caste of Cohanim. Synagogues in the mountains of India and China and Catholic churches with a Jewish identity in New Mexico  and Colorado   provide different patterns of connection within the tangled history of the Jewish diaspora. Legendary accounts of the Hebrew lineage of Ethiopian tribesmen, the building of Africa 's Great Zimbabwe fortress, and even the so-called Lost Tribes are reexamined in light of advanced DNA technology. Entine also reveals the shared ancestry of Israelites and Christians. As people from across the world discover their Israelite roots, their riveting stories unveil exciting new approaches to defining one's identity. Not least, Entine addresses possible connections between DNA and Jewish intelligence and the controversial notion that Jews are a ""race apart."" ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN is a compelling reinterpretation of biblical history and a challenging and exciting illustration of the promise and power of genetic research.   Read more Read less"
"title : People without Government: An Anthropology of Anarchy - author : Harold B. Barclaycategory : anthropologydescription : Anarchie, also die Abwesenheit von Herrschaft, ist weder Chaos noch irgendeine unrealisierbare Utopie. Und tatsächlich scheint sie zumindest in der Vergangenheit eine sehr verbreitete Form der politischen Organisation gewesen zu sein.  Der kanadische Anthropologe Harold Barclay beschreibt in seiner Arbeit „Völker ohne Regierung“ verschiedene sog. „primitive“ Gesellschaften, deren politische Strukturen als anarchisch charakterisiert werden können. Obwohl es sich bei diesen Völkern vorwiegend um kleinere archaische Gruppen von Jägern, Sammlern, Pflanzern, Ackerbauern und Hirten handelt, weisen auch größere Bevölkerungsgruppen mit komplexeren Gesellschaftsstrukturen anarchische Merkmale in ihren politischen Beziehungen auf. Barclay gibt daher ausgehend von seiner Untersuchung verschiedener Gesellschaften in Afrika, Nord- und Südamerika, Australien, Asien und Nordeuropa einen Überblick über das historisch breite Spektrum von Gesellschaften mit libertären Tendenzen.  Aus der Sicht des Anthropologen versucht der Autor in seiner Untersuchung, vor allem die Praxis der Anarchie aufzuzeigen. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit widmet er dabei den verschiedenen Techniken der Führung, der Aufrechterhaltung von Ordnung und den politischen Entscheidungsprozessen. Barclay zeigt das dynamische Wechselspiel zwischen Freiheit und Autorität auf, das in der weitverbreiteten Tendenz der anarchischen Gesellschaften, in Staaten mit einer Regierung zu degenerieren, zum Ausdruck kommt und ein Trend ist, der bei kleineren Gruppen die Entwicklung zur Oligarchie begünstigt.

"title : Make way for Lucia (Mapp & Lucia #6) - author : E. F. Bensoncategory : anthropologydescription : 6 books in one volume:  #1 - Queen Lucia    Mrs. Lucas, Lucia to her intimates, resides in the village of Riseholme, a pretty Elizabethan village in Worcestershire, where she vigorously guards her status as ""Queen"" despite occasional attempts from her subjects to overthrow her. Lucia’s dear friend Georgie Pillson both worships Lucia and occasionally works to subvert her power.  #2 - Miss Mapp    Arch-schemer and social climber, Miss Mapp spends her days using opera glasses and a notebook to chart her neighbors' affairs. Among her interests are Major Benjamin Flint, whom she has been trying to marry for years.  #3 - Lucia in London    Here is Lucia in one of her most extraordinary adventures: can she conquer her new home of London, and still hold her societal ground over the stately country mansions of Riseholme as well? Will the citizens of Riseholme - hurt and maddened by Lucia's desertion for the great city - carry out their plot of revenge?  #4 - Mapp and Lucia    Subtly brilliant comedy of social rivalry between the wars. Emmeline Lucas (known universally to her friends as Lucia) is an arch-snob of the highest order. In Miss Elizabeth Mapp of Mallards Lucia meets her match. Ostensibly the most civil and genteel of society ladies, there is no plan too devious, no plot too cunning, no depths to which they would not sink, in order to win the battle for social supremacy. Using as their deadly weapons garden parties, bridge evenings and charming teas, the two combatants strive to outcharm each other - and the whole of Tilling society - as they vie for the position of doyenne of the town.  #5 - The Worshipful Lucia (aka Lucia's Progress)    Both Lucia and Mapp stand for election to the Town Council, and Lucia speculates in gold shares. While redecorating Miss Mapp's house, Lucia discovers and hide the remains of a Roman Villa. Excitements ensue!  #6 - Trouble for Lucia    Lucia learns to ride a bicycle, and we live through the saga of Blue Birdie (Mrs. Wyse's dead budgerigar [parakeet] invoked in a seance). Lucia and Georgie renew their acquaintance with the operatic diva Olga Braceley and the composer Cortese, but nobody in Tilling believes her when she claims to have entertained a duchess overnight. Lucia becomes Mayor of Tilling and Miss Mapp is appointed her Mayoress.   Read more Read less"

"title : Jihad Beyond Islam - author : Gabriele Marrancicategory : anthropologydescription : 'Jihad' is a highly charged word. Often mistranslated as 'Holy War', it has become synonymous with terrorism. Current political events have entirely failed to take account of the subtlety and complexity of jihad. Like many concepts with a long history, different cultural ideas have influenced the religious aspects of jihad. As a result its original meaning has been adapted, modified and destabilized - never more than at the present time. How does jihad manifest itself in Muslims' everyday lives? What impact has 9/11 and its backlash had on jihad? By observing the current crisis of identity among ordinary Muslims, this timely book explores why, and in what circumstances Muslims speak of jihad. In the end, jihad is what Muslims say it is. Marranci offers us a nuanced and sophisticated anthropological understanding of Muslims' lives far beyond the predictable cliches.Have a look at the author´s blog hereExplores the different cultural ideas that have influenced the religious aspects of jihad.

"title : Home - author : Johannes Lenhardcategory : anthropologydescription : ""How are notions of 'home' made and negotiated by ethnographers? And how does the researcher relate to forms of home encountered during fieldwork? Rather than searching for an abstract, philosophical understanding of home, this collection asks how home gains its meaning and significance through ongoing efforts to create, sustain or remake a sense of home. The volume explores how researchers and informants alike are always involved in the process of making and unmaking home, and challenges readers to reimagine ethnographic practice in terms of active, morally complex process of home-making. Contributions reach across the globe and across social contexts, and the book includes chapters on council housing and middle-class apartment buildings, homelessness and migration, problems with accessing the field as well as limiting it, physical as well as sentimental notions of home, and objects as well as inter-human social relations. Home draws attention to processes of sociality that normally remain analytically invisible, and contributes to a growing and rich field of study on the anthropology of home.""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Mapping human history - author : Steve Olsoncategory : anthropologydescription : Until just a few years ago, we knew surprisingly little about the 150,000 or so years of human existence before the advent of writing. Some of the most momentous events in our past--including our origins, our migrations across the globe, and our acquisition of language--were veiled in the uncertainty of ""prehistory."" That veil is being lifted at last by geneticists and other scientists. Mapping Human History is nothing less than an astonishing ""history of prehistory."" Best of all, the story it tells, of why groups of humans differ and what those differences mean, pertains to our lives today. Steve Olson traveled through four continents to gather insights into the development of humans and our expansion throughout the world. He describes, for example, new thinking about how centers of agriculture sprang up from disparate foraging societies at roughly the same time. He tells us why we can all claim Julius Caesar and Confucius among our forebears. He pinpoints the ways in which the story of the Jewish people jibes with, and diverges from, biblical accounts. And, using very recent genetic findings, he explodes the myth that human races are a biological reality. In the tradition of Guns, Germs, and Steel, Olson's Mapping Human History offers an ambitious, original, and convincing narrative that reveals where we came from and how we became who we are possibly have biological origins.

This book offers an original approach to ethnolinguistics, discussing how abstract concepts such as truth, love, hate and war are expressed across cultures and ethnicities. James W. Underhill seeks to situate these key cultural concepts within four languages (English, French, Czech and German). Not only do these concepts differ from language to language, but they go on changing over time. The book explores issues such as how far meaning is politically and culturally influenced, how far language shapes the thought of ethnic groups and how far their thought shapes language, and the role of individuals in the consolidation of cultural concepts.

"title : Anticapitalism and Culture - author : Jeremy Gilbertcategory : anthropologydescription : What does 'anticapitalism' really mean for the politics and culture of the twenty-first century? Anticapitalism is an idea which, despite going global, remains rooted in the local, persisting as a loose collection of grassroots movements and actions. Anticapitalism needs to develop a coherent and cohering philosophy, something which cultural theory and the intellectual legacy of the New Left can help to provide, notably through the work of key radical thinkers, such as Ernesto Laclau, Stuart Hall, Antonio Negri, Gilles Deleuze and Judith Butler.  Anticapitalism and Culture argues that there is a strong relationship between the radical tradition of cultural studies and the new political movements which try to resist corporate globalization.  Indeed, the two need each other: whilst theory can shape and direct the huge diversity of anticapitalist activism, the energy and sheer political engagement of the anticapitalist movement can breathe new life into cultural studies.Anticapitalism is an idea which, despite going global, remains rooted in the local, persisting as a loose collection of    grassroots movements and actions.

"title : Civil Society in Algeria - author : Andrea Liveranicategory : anthropologydescription : Since 1987 Algeria has been engaged in a conflict pitching the army against Islamist guerilla groups which has killed more than 200.000 people. During the same period, Algeria also witnessed the explosion of more than 70,000 voluntary associations, making it one of the most civic-dense countries in the Arab world. This book analyses the development of these association in Algeria and the state’s attempt to retain political legitimacy.  Starting from a critique of portrayals of Algerian ‘civil society’ as a force conducive to democratization, the study examines the changing relationship of the state to voluntary associations in both the colonial and post-colonial eras. An in-depth assessment of the social bases of the associative sphere then leads to questioning its independence from the state, and highlights the role of the associative sector in tempering the fracture between the state and those social groups that most suffered from the collapse of Algeria’s post colonial political framework. Finally, the study analyses donors’ use of advocacy and service-delivery associations in democracy-promotion programmes, arguing that their focus on the country’s ‘civil society’ contributed to the state’s efforts to preserve its international legitimacy.  Based on in-depth examination of existing literature and extensive fieldwork conducted at a time when Algeria was still closed to foreign researchers because of the conflict, Andrea Liverani challenges the mainstream views on the political role of associations in democracy, illustrating how ‘civil society’ can work towards the conservation of an authoritarian order, rather than simply towards democratic change. A lucid contribution to an emerging scholarship, Civil Society in Algeria will appeal to students, academic experts, and NGO/aid practitioners.   Read more Read less"
"title : The anthropology of magic - author : Susan Greenwoodcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Magic is arguably the least understood subject in anthropology today. Exotic and fascinating, it offers us a glimpse into another world but it also threatens to undermine the foundations of anthropology due to its supposed irrational and non-scientific nature. Magic has thus often been 'explained away' by social or psychological reduction. The Anthropology of Magic redresses the balance and brings magic, as an aspect of consciousness, into focus through the use of classic texts and cutting-edge research. Suitable for student and scholar alike, The Anthropology of Magic updates a classical anthropological debate concerning the nature of human experience. A key theme is that human beings everywhere have the potential for magical consciousness. Taking a new approach to some perennial topics in anthropology--such as shamanism, mythology, witchcraft, and healing--the book raises crucial theoretical and methodological issues to provide the reader with an engaging and critical understanding of the dynamics of magic""--Provided by publisher.

At Koobi Fora, on the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya, he and his team are piecing together not only the anatomy of our ancient ancestors, but their social behavior as well. Heir to one of the most renowned names in anthropology, Leakey and his colleagues have discovered more fossils in a few short years than most anthropologists do in a lifetime. At Lake Turkana, Leakey, his wife, Meave, and their fossil hunting team have unearthed over 300 bones belonging to more than 180 of our early forebears. These include one of the most significant finds of this decade, skull 1470, which suggests that the human line may have emerged in Africa an amazing four million years ago. Now, in people of the lake, Leakey tells how he uncovered these clues to our prehistoric past and what they reveal about our emotional and intellectual life. A brilliant scientific detective story by one of the great anthropologists of our time, PEOPLE OF THE LAKE provides a new perspective not only on mankind’s evolutionary past, but on the meaning of human nature itself.

"title : The birth and death of meaning - author : Ernest Beckercategory : anthropologydescription : This book represents the first of Becker's final trilogy, what can be considered his mature theoretical work. In this book, Becker begins his presentation of what he confidently feels is a unified and well rounded general theory of human nature. He also has come to terms with Freud and Freudian theory, meaning that he is now able to deal appreciatively with what psychoanalysis has contributed with this general theory of human nature. It is also important to note that Becker also announces in his Preface that he now recognizes the fact that in his earlier work, he had slighted the underside of human nature. That is, as a social scientist in the tradition of Rousseau, he was dedicated to the view that human nature is essentially neutral or good and that it is corrupted by the social environment. The theory presented now in his mature work has come to a more clear understanding of the element of the darker side, the side of human nature which is evil and vicious. This considerably sobers his earlier optimism about human possibilities and potentials, guided by an actively engaged social science. As is clear, however, Becker’s recognition of the element of human viciousness and evil does not push him toward cynicism or despair.

It symbolizes the perception of Bushman or San society, of the ideas and values of ethnographers who have worked with Bushman peoples, and those of other anthropologists who use this work.

It reveals the impact of Bushman studies on anthropology and on the public. The book highlights how Bushman or San ethnography has contributed to anthropological controversy, for example in the debates on the degree of incorporation of San society within the wider political economy, and on the validity of the case for 'indigenous rights' as a special kind of human rights. Examining the changing image of the Bushman, Barnard provides a new contribution to an established anthropology debate.'The Bushman' is a perennial but changing image.

With the recent developments in DNA and computer technologies, the field of anthropological genetics has been redefined. This volume deals with the molecular revolution and how DNA markers can provide insight into the processes of evolution, the mapping of genes for complex phenotypes and the reconstruction of the human diaspora. In addition to this, there are explanations of the technological developments and how they affect the fields of forensic anthropology and population studies, alongside the methods of field investigations and their contribution to anthropological genetics.

"title : How to Argue With a Racist - author : Adam Rutherfordcategory : anthropologydescription : Racist pseudoscience has become so commonplace that it can be hard to spot. But its toxic effects on society are plain to see—feeding white nationalism, fueling hatred, endangering lives, and corroding our discourse on everything from sports to intelligence. Even well-intentioned people repeat stereotypes based on “science,” because cutting-edge genetics are hard to grasp—and all too easy to distort. Paradoxically, these misconceptions are multiplying even as scientists make unprecedented discoveries in human genetics—findings that, when accurately understood, are powerful evidence against racism. We’ve never had clearer answers about who we are and where we come from, but this knowledge is sorely needed in our casual conversations about race.  How to Argue With a Racist emphatically dismantles outdated notions of race by illuminating what modern genetics actually can and can’t tell us about human difference. We now know that the racial categories still dividing us do not align with observable genetic differences. In fact, our differences are so minute that, most of all, they serve as evidence of our shared humanity.   Read more Read less"

Sokolowski highlights the role of the spoken word in human reason and examines the bodily and neurological basis for human experience.

"title : Creating conditions - author : Katie Featherstonecategory : anthropologydescription : ""Based on original ethnographic research with scientists, clinicians and families, this book examines Rett syndrome to illuminate more general issues concerning the construction and interpretation of diseases and syndromes. It derives from research with a specialist team of clinicians and scientists, and a series of families referred with a potential diagnosis of Rett syndrome, and documents the scientific, clinical, patient and family experiences over a three-year period. Although Rett syndrome itself is rare, it is one of some 2,000 such syndromes, and its genetic basis has recently been linked to the much broader Autism spectrum. From a sociological or anthropological point of view, it is also of considerable interest as a clinical entity that is undergoing transformation in the light of recent post-genomic research. Traditionally, such syndromes have been diagnosed clinically, but increasingly genetic technologies are having an impact on the diagnosis, description and classification of conditions. Rett Syndrome is thus a key exemplar of the implications of genetic medicine that are far-reaching and extend well beyond this particular syndrome""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Interpreting ancient figurines - author : Richard G. Lesurecategory : anthropologydescription : ""This book examines ancient figurines from several world areas to address recurring challenges in the interpretation of prehistoric art. Sometimes figurines from one context are perceived to resemble those from another. Richard G. Lesure asks whether such resemblances play a role in our interpretations. Early interpreters seized on the idea that figurines were recurringly female and constructed the fanciful myth of a primordial Neolithic Goddess. Contemporary practice instead rejects interpretive leaps across contexts. Dr. Lesure offers a middle path: a new framework for assessing the relevance of particular comparisons. He develops the argument in case studies that consider figurines from Paleolithic Europe, the Neolithic Near East, and Formative Mesoamerica""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less"
"title : Against Hybridity - author : Haim Hazancategory : anthropologydescription : ""One of the major characteristics of our contemporary culture is a positive, almost banal, view of the transgression and disruption of cultural boundaries. Strangers, migrants and nomads are celebrated in our postmodern world of hybrids and cyborgs. But we pay a price for this celebration of hybridity: the non-hybrid figures in our societies are ignored, rejected, silenced or exterminated. This book tells the story of these non-hybrid figures Ð the anti-heroes of our pop culture.The main example of non-hybrids in an otherwise hybridized world is that of deep old age. Hazan shows how we fervently distance ourselves from old age by grading and sequencing it into stages such as 'the third age', 'the fourth age' and so on. Aging bodies are manipulated through anti-aging techniques until it is no longer possible to do it anymore, at which point they become un-transformable and non-marketable objects and hence commercially and socially invisible or masked. Other examples are used to elucidate the same cultural logic of the non-hybrid: pain, the Holocaust, autism, fundamentalism and corporeal death. On the face of it, these examples may seem to have nothing in common, but they all exemplify the same cultural logic of the non-hybrid and provoke similar reactions of criticism, terror, abhorrence and moral indignation.This highly original and iconoclastic book offers a fresh critique of contemporary Western culture by focusing on that which is perceived as its other Ð the non-hybrid in our midst, often rejected, ignored or silenced and deemed to be in need of globally manageable correction""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Rethinking Business Anthropology - author : Alf H. Wallecategory : anthropologydescription : ""Qualitative methods of business research are emerging as vital tools. Business anthropology is at the heart of this movement. Although many recent books provide nuts-and-bolts advice regarding the field, Rethinking Business Anthropology: Cultural Strategies in Marketing and Management discusses the intellectual traditions from which the discipline has emerged and how this heritage opens up new vistas for business research. Gaining these broader perspectives is essential as business anthropologists transcend being mere research technicians and seek to influence organizational policies and strategies. Opening chapters deal with the current status of the field and its relationship to ecological and cultural sustainability. This is followed by discussions of the intellectual foundations of anthropology and their continued importance to business anthropology. An array of chapters provides illustrative applications of business anthropology in order to demonstrate the field's unique and powerful potentials within both scholarly and practitioner research. The book concludes with a discussion of the role of business anthropologists in dealing with indigenous people, rural populations, and cultural enclaves. Increasingly, businesses seek to connect with such communities even though mainstream leaders and negotiators often lack the skills necessary to effectively do so. Business anthropologists, with their dual background in business and cultural diversity are poised to excel in this capacity. An appendix by Robert Tian, editor of the International Journal of Business Anthropology, provides a useful overview of the field as it now exists. As business anthropology comes of age, this timely monograph provides the perspectives needed for the growth and further development of the field and those who work within it. Excellent for the professional bookshelf and as a textbook.""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less"

"title : Asian children at home and at school - author : Ghazala Bhatticategory : anthropologydescription : This book is an ethnographic study of a comprehensive school in the south of England. It explores the views of teachers, Asian parents and their children concerning education and schooling. Young people between the ages of 13 and 18 were studied at home and at school and their experiences form the main focus of the study. The experiences of fifty Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian families - mostly of Muslim faith - are studied with a view to discovering what parents expect from their children's school and how the teachers perceive their own role with regard to their students. These young people are the first generation of Asians to be educated in Britain. Their location in terms of their social class positions, gender and ethnicity are inextricably bound together. They describe how they see their past and their future. This is the first study to take account of boys and girls in order to capture the complexity of their lived experiences.   Read more Read less"
"title : The undivided past - author : David Cannadinecategory : anthropologydescription : ""Investigating the six most salient categories of human identity, difference, and confrontation—religion, nation, class, gender, race, and civilization—David Cannadine questions just how determinative each of them has really been. For while each has motivated people dramatically at particular moments, they have rarely been as pervasive, as divisive, or as important as is suggested by such simplified polarities as “us versus them,” “black versus white,” or “the clash of civilizations.” For most of recorded time, these identities have been more fluid and these differences less unbridgeable than political leaders, media commentators—and some historians—would have us believe. Throughout history, in fact, fruitful conversations have continually taken place across these allegedly impermeable boundaries of identity: the world, as Cannadine shows, has never been simply and starkly divided between any two adversarial solidarities but always an interplay of overlapping constituencies. Yet our public discourse is polarized more than ever around the same simplistic divisions, and Manichean narrative has become the default mode to explain everything that is happening in the world today. With wide-ranging erudition, David Cannadine compellingly argues against the pervasive and pernicious idea that conflict is the inevitable state of human affairs. The Undivided Past is an urgently needed work of history, one that is also about the present—and the future""--amazon.com.   Read more Read less"
"title : The dark side of humanity - author : Robert Parkincategory : anthropologydescription : For the social anthropologist, the work of Robert Hertz has assumed more importance than that of any other scholar attached to the school of Emile Durkheim, excluding only Marcel Mauss and Durkheim himself. This is due mainly to the influence of his two key texts concerning ritual and symbolism, that on death of 1907 and that on right and left hands of 1909. His other works are now also becoming better known, namely his recently translated work on sin (first published in 1922), and his ethnographic study of the cult St. Besse, in northern Italy (1913). Robert Parkin's book gives a reading of each of these texts before going on to show their subsequent influence on anthropologists in particular. Hertz's activities as reviewer and pamphleteer are also covered. The introductory biographical chapter, drawing on Hertz's surviving papers in the College de France, shows his own ambivalence towards his academic career and it also attempts to clarify the circumstances leading up to his apparently gratuitous death in the First World War. Two further chapters attempt to situate his work in the broader context of Durkheimian sociology.   Read more Read less"
"title : The archaeology of islands - author : Paul Rainbirdcategory : anthropologydescription : Archaeologists have traditionally considered islands as distinct physical and social entities. In this book, Paul Rainbird discusses the historical construction of this characterization and questions the basis for such an understanding of island archaeology. Through a series of case studies of prehistoric archaeology in the Mediterranean, Pacific, Baltic, and Atlantic seas and oceans, he argues for a decentering of the land in favor of an emphasis on the archaeology of the sea and, ultimately, a new perspective on the making of maritime communities. The archaeology of islands is thus unshackled from approaches that highlight boundedness and isolation, and replaced with a new set of principles - that boundaries are fuzzy, islanders are distinctive in their expectation of contacts with people from over the seas, and that island life can tell us much about maritime communities. Debating islands, thus, brings to the fore issues of identity and community and a concern with Western construction of other peoples.   Read more Read less"
"title : The structure of evil - author : Ernest Beckercategory : anthropologydescription : The history of the science of man that I draw in these pages is based on the following assumptions, and seeks to support them:  In order to understand the problem of a unified science of man today, we must go back at least to the decline of the medieval cosmology, and to the more or less decisive break from the old order that took the form of the French Enlightenment and, subsequently, the French Revolution. [...]    In the second place, each rereading of history is occupied with ""new"" facts, even if it uses facts that have been used time and time again. [...]    The specific vantage point that I use for this rereading of history II is a new, unified theory of human behavior. The theory has been very long and very slow in the making, and it is only now that it has become possible to articulate it. This means that my endeavor is a circular one, but I hope a justified, self-reinforcing circularity: a new reading of history that derives from a new theoretical understanding; and a new theoretical understanding that is substantiated by a new reading of history. The circularity, then, is not a ""vicious"" or sterile one, but rather an incremental one of enhanced logical consistency, and added insight and meaningfulness.  This book, then, is actually the third of a trilogy, which records the development of my ideas and the substantiation of the early perspectives I reached for. In the first work, The Birth and Death of Meaning: A Perspective in Psychiatry and Anthropology, I pulled together an abstract scheme for conceptualizing human behavior, and offered a suggestion for a new orientation for the science of man. The book was directed partly against the ascendancy of medical-psychiatric explanations of human behavior, including Freudian, instinctivist ones. Thus it stressed the largely fictional nature of human meanings, the uniquely linguistic aspects of human experience, and the wholly social-psychological genesis of the self.  In a second work, The Revolution in Psychiatry: The New Understanding of Man, I attempted to fill out this perspective by elaborating comprehensive, social-behavioral theories of mental illness. This second book sought to provide a broader and more detailed explanation of human action and its failures, and to see them as grounded in total, organismic functioning—and not merely in symbolic, linguistic modes. On the one hand, it had to do this without losing the truth of the symbolic approach, specifically, of the social-psychological explanation of the origin and nature of the human self, and how it functions in social interaction. On the other hand, it had to accomplish this total organismic restatement without resorting to the facile reductionist and Freudian-instinctivist explanations of total biological functioning. These two works supplied, I think, the necessary basis for a unified theory of action.  The present, third work, finally, complements the first two, by rounding out and substantiating historically a unified theory of action. Its task is to place the whole understanding of human nature into the historical perspective of the past two centuries, during which time this understanding was gradually being developed. Furthermore, it continues the task begun in the second book, which is to introduce frankly ideas from philosophy and naturalistic descriptive ontology and to attempt to show their indispensable place in a science of man.    The overall result, I dare to hope, is an integral framework for setting in motion a socially experimental science of man—something we have been building for over two centuries.

"title : Manual of forensic taphonomy - author : James T. Pokinescategory : anthropologydescription : ""Forensic taphonomy is the study of the postmortem changes to human remains, focusing largely on environmental effects - including decomposition in soil and water and interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. While other books have focused on subsets such as forensic botany and entomology, Manual of Forensic Taphonomy is the first update of the entire domain in more than ten years and the first book to consider distinguishing among multiple types of taphonomic changes. Edited by two of the most distinguished experts in the field, this volume examines taphonomic alterations to bone and related taphonomic processes common to cases of forensic interest ... The ability to recognize taphonomic characteristics and discriminate between osseous alterations with similar appearances but dissimilar origins is essential to those engaged in the analysis of skeletal remains.

"title : Design with the Desert - author : Richard Malloycategory : anthropologydescription : The modern southwestern cities of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, and El Paso occupy lands that once supported rich desert ecosystems. Typical development activities often resulted in scraping these desert lands of an ancient living landscape, to be replaced with one that is human-made and dependent on a large consumption of energy and natural resources. Design with the Desert: Conservation and Sustainable Development explores the natural and built environment of the American Southwest and introduces development tools for shaping the future of the region in a more sustainable way. Explore the Desert Landscape and Ecology This transdisciplinary collaboration draws on insights from leading authorities in their fields, spanning science, ecology, planning, landscape development, architecture, and urban design. Organized into five parts, the book begins by introducing the physical aspects of the desert realm: the land, geology, water, and climate. The second part deals with the ""living"" and ecological aspects, from plants and animals to ecosystems. The third part, on planning in the desert, covers the ecological and social issues surrounding water, natural resource planning, and community development. Bring the Desert into the City The fourth part looks at how to bring nature into the built environment through the use of native plants, the creation of habitats for nature in urban settings, and the design of buildings, communities, and projects that create life. The final part of the book focuses on urban sustainability and how to design urban systems that provide a secure future for community development. Topics include water security, sustainable building practices, and bold architecture and community designs. Design Solutions That Work with the Local Environment This book will inspire discussion and contemplation for anyone interested in desert development, from developers and environmentalists to planners, community leaders, and those who live in desert regions. Throughout this volume, the contributors present solutions to help promote ecological balance between nature and the built environment in the American Southwest—and offer valuable insights for other ecologically fragile regions around the world.

"title : Justice and governance in East Timor - author : Rod Nixoncategory : anthropologydescription : ""Focusing on the case study of Timor Leste, this book presents the New Subsistence State as a conceptual tool for understanding governance challenges in countries characterised by subsistence economic and social relations. It examines the ways in which Timor Leste conforms to the typology of the New Subsistence State, taking into consideration geographic, historical and socio-political aspects. The book defines a New Subsistence State as an overwhelmingly subsistence economy corresponding to little or no historical experience of the generation and administration of large surpluses, with minimal labour specialisation, and the predominance, especially in rural areas, of traditional authority relations. It looks at how these features restrict the capacity of the new state to operate effectively in accordance with the modern state model. The book presents a case for prioritising sustainable approaches to public administration in New Subsistence State contexts. It goes on to examine the historical role of village justice systems, and demonstrates how a community justice and mediation program building on existing capacities could prove an economical means of promoting human rights values and reducing the burden on the national courts.""--Publisher's description.

"title : Why nations fail - author : Daron Acemoglucategory : anthropologydescription : Why are some nations rich and others poor, divided by wealth and poverty, health and sickness, food and famine?  Is it culture, the weather, or geography that determines prosperity or poverty? As Why Nations Fail shows, none of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Drawing on fifteen years of original research, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is our man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or the lack of it). Korea, to take just one example, is a remarkably homogeneous nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created those two different institutional trajectories. Acemoglu and Robinson marshal extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, among them:  Will China's economy continue to grow at such a high speed and ultimately overwhelm the West?  Are America's best days behind it? Are we creating a vicious cycle that enriches and empowers a small minority?   Read more Read less"
"title : The evolutionary biology of human body fatness - author : Jonathan C. K. Wellscategory : anthropologydescription : ""This comprehensive synthesis of current medical and evolutionary literature addresses key questions about the role body fat plays in human biology. It explores how body energy stores are regulated, how they develop over the life-course, what biological functions they serve, and how they may have evolved.  There is now substantial evidence that human adiposity is not merely a buffer against the threat of starvation, but is also a resource for meeting the energy costs of growth, reproduction and immune function. As such it may be considered as important in our species evolution as other traits such as bipedalism, large brains, and long life spans and developmental periods. Indeed, adiposity is integrally linked with these other traits, and with our capacity to colonise and inhabit diverse ecosystems. It is because human metabolism is so sensitive to environmental cues that manipulative economic forces are now generating the current obesity epidemic""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less"
"title : Maps of the mind: Charts and Concepts of the Mind and its Labyrinths - author : Charles Hampden-Turnercategory : anthropologydescription : This is a sort of textbook or interpretative reference book on the mind, featuring 60 ""maps"" or graphic illustrations on nine levels.  Some maps feature more than one thinker, and some thinkers, including Hampden-Turner himself, are featured in more than one map.  Levels include history/religion, psychoanalytic/existential, physiological, creativity, development, language/symbols/communication, cybernetics/psychobiology, paradigms, and myth. It includes revisions and extensions of his own 10 part theory of the ""radical person,"" first published in Radical Man.  This is not a book to read from cover to cover, but rather invites one to browse and follow his links through these labyrinths of the mind. Leafing through the pages one is caught by the fascinating illustrations. While it is a challenging read for undergrads, it could nevertheless serve them well as a reference for term papers on a variety of topics. Many of the descriptions are reasonably readable.

"title : The archaeology of Micronesia - author : Paul Rainbirdcategory : anthropologydescription : This is the first book-length archaeological study of Micronesia, a collection of island groups in the Western Pacific Ocean. Drawing on a wide range of archaeological, anthropological and historical sources, the author explores the various ways that the societies of these islands have been interpreted since European navigators first arrived there in the sixteenth century. Considering the process of initial colonisation on the island groups of Marianas, Carolines, Marshalls and Kiribati, he examines the histories of these islands and explores how the neighbouring areas are drawn together through notions of fusion, fluidity and flux. The author places this region within the broader arena of pacific island studies and addresses contemporary debates such as origins, processes of colonisation, social organisation, environmental change and the interpretation of material culture. This book will be essential reading for any scholar with an interest in the archaeology of the Pacific.   Read more Read less"
"title : The Best of All Possible Worlds - author : Karen Lordcategory : anthropologydescription : Karen Lord’s debut novel, the multiple-award-winning Redemption in Indigo, announced the appearance of a major new talent—a strong, brilliantly innovative voice fusing Caribbean storytelling traditions and speculative fiction with subversive wit and incisive intellect. Compared by critics to such heavyweights as Nalo Hopkinson, China Miéville, and Ursula K. Le Guin, Lord does indeed belong in such select company—yet, like them, she boldly blazes her own trail.  Now Lord returns with a second novel that exceeds the promise of her first. The Best of All Possible Worlds is a stunning science fiction epic that is also a beautifully wrought, deeply moving love story.  A proud and reserved alien society finds its homeland destroyed in an unprovoked act of aggression, and the survivors have no choice but to reach out to the indigenous humanoids of their adopted world, to whom they are distantly related. They wish to preserve their cherished way of life but come to discover that in order to preserve their culture, they may have to change it forever.  Now a man and a woman from these two clashing societies must work together to save this vanishing race—and end up uncovering ancient mysteries with far-reaching ramifications. As their mission hangs in the balance, this unlikely team—one cool and cerebral, the other fiery and impulsive—just may find in each other their own destinies . . . and a force that transcends all.  “This fascinating and thoughtful science fiction novel breaks out of the typical conflict-centered narrative paradigm to examine adaptation, social change, and human relationships. I’ve not read anything quite like it, which it makes that rare beast: a true original.”—Kate Elliot, author of the Crown of Stars series and the Spiritwalker Trilogy   Read more Read less"
"title : Fundamentals of forensic anthropology - author : Linda L. Klepingercategory : anthropologydescription : An essential foundation for the practice of forensic anthropology   This text is the first of its level written in more than twenty years. It serves as a summary and guide to the core material that needs to be mastered and evaluated for the practice of forensic anthropology.   The text is divided into three parts that collectively provide a solid base in theory and methodology:    Part One, ""Background Setting for Forensic Anthropology,"" introduces the field and discusses the role of forensic anthropology in historic context.  Part Two, ""Towards Personal Identification,"" discusses initial assessments of skeletal remains; determining sex, age, ancestral background, and stature; and skeletal markers of activity and life history.  Part Three, ""Principal Anthropological Roles in Medical-Legal Investigation,"" examines trauma; the postmortem period; professionalism, ethics, and the expert witness; and genetics and DNA.     The critical and evaluative approach to the primary literature stresses the inherent biological constraints on degrees of precision and certainty, and cautions about potential pitfalls. The practical focus, coupled with theoretical basics, make Fundamentals of Forensic Anthropology ideal for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students in biological anthropology as well as forensic scientists in allied fields of medical-legal investigation.

"title : Of Women Born - author : Adrienne Richcategory : anthropologydescription : «Sabemos mucho más acerca del aire que respiramos o de los mares que atravesamos, que acerca de la naturaleza y del significado de la maternidad». En medio del clima de activismo y publicación feminista de los años setenta del siglo XX, la cuestión de la maternidad no había sido abordada en toda su complejidad hasta la aparición de este libro. Nacemos de mujer fue publicado en 1976. En este trabajo, Adrienne Rich aunó vivencias, investigación histórica y antropológica y reflexión feminista con el propósito de radiografiar la «institución de maternidad»: la maternidad bajo el patriarcado como un conjunto de normas y controles que organizan las funciones de la familia y las labores de las «mujeres» respecto de su rol programado socialmente. Enfrentada a esta institución, la autora apostó por recuperar la palabra «maternidad» junto con la experiencia única, diversa, personal, compartida, en un análisis abierto que no deja de abordar los condicionamientos, las imposiciones y los roles. En nuestro tiempo, aún, tenemos mucho que pensar sobre cómo el capitalismo y el patriarcado usurpan las experiencias de los cuerpos gestantes; por eso, disponer de Nacemos de mujer es un excelente punto de partida.

"title : No Bone Unturned - author : Jeff Benedictcategory : anthropologydescription : A curator for the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, Doug Owsley painstakingly rebuilds skeletons, helping to identify them and determine their cause of death. He has worked on several notorious cases -- from mass graves uncovered in Croatia to the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon -- and has examined historic skeletons tens of thousands of years old. But the discovery of Kennewick Man, a 9,600-year-old human skeleton found along the banks of Washington's Columbia River, was a find that would turn Owsley's life upside down.Days before Owsley was scheduled to study the skeleton, the government seized it to bury Kennewick Man's bones on the land of the Native American tribes who claimed him. Along with other leading scientists, Owsley sued the U.S. government over custody. Concerned that knowledge about our past and our history would be lost forever if the bones were reburied, Owsley fought a legal and political battle for six years, putting everything at risk, jeopardizing his career and his reputation.

"title : Promoting Heritage Language in Northwest Russia - author : Laura Siragusacategory : anthropologydescription : This volume illustrates how language revival movements in Russia and elsewhere have often followed a specific pattern of literacy bias in the promotion of a minority’s heritage language, partly neglecting the social and relational aspects of orality. Using the Vepsian Renaissance as an example, this volume brings to the surface a literacy-orality dualism new to the discussion around revival movements. In addition to the more-theoretically oriented scopes, this book addresses all the actors involved in revival movements including activists, scholars and policy-makers, and opens a discussion on literacy and orality, and power and agency in the multiple relational aspects of written and oral practices. This study addresses issues common to language revival movements worldwide and will appeal to researchers of linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, education and language policy, and culture studies.

This book is the definitive guide to the range of Victorian poets and poems, from the famous to the less well known. Approaching the poets and poems in the light of both Victorian and modern critical concerns, this absorbing book places poetry written during the nineteenth century in its personal, aesthetic, historical, and ideological contexts, and considers the poets' major anxieties, such as self, body, and melancholy. The author insists that rhyming and repetition are the major formal features of this (or any) poetry and focuses on the Victorian obsession with small subjects in small poems. The Victorians, at the helm of a global empire, were innovative and ambitious, and the poetry of the age reflects the aspirations and self-consciousness of Victorian society. Esteemed critic, Valentine Cunningham, exhibits encyclopedic knowledge of the poetry produced in this period and, with dazzling close readings of a number of poems, cuts through the often complex Victorian poetic form to reveal the key themes and contexts of the poems and the passions that drove the men and women who wrote them""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Salmon - author : Jessie Lendenniecategory : poetrydescription : Salmon: A Journey in Poetry 1981-2007 celebrates 26 years of innovative and exciting Irish and international poetry. The organization of the volume is simple: two poems from the poet’s Salmon collection (or collections) and one uncollected poem. Detailed biographical notes for each poet, and a complete bilbiography of Salmon's publications, are also included.  ""A treasure-trove of poetry from Salmon. This is one anthology that is worth its weight."" Hugh McFadden, Books Ireland  ""At the end of the reader’s brief visits with more than 100 contemporary Irish, British, American, and Canadian poets, there are places I want to revisit, other Salmon volumes I want to read. I want to linger longer with the poems of David Cavanagh, Theodore Deppe, Melanie Frances and Michael Heffernan.  I want to hear Rory Brennan tell me about a placewhere On past / The smart new housing for the unemployed the diesels / Churn and hiss, trailing a dragon tang out to / The crane-forested docks and the ferry’s leviathan jaw. Want Heffernan to keep on describing a gray abyss the lacy disks / of the wild carrot where my peppers were / stir into spots of incandescent white / between the river meadow and my eyes. Hope to again hear the voice of Richard Tillinghast, much as it begins “A Quiet Pint in Kinvara”: Salt-stung, rain-cleared air, deepened as always / By a smudge of turf smoke. Overhead the white glide / Of seagulls, and in the convent beeches above the road, / Hoarse croak of rooks, throaty chatter of jackdaws.  In this anthology, Jessie Lendennie brings us 318 poems she has gathered along her path from Arkansas to County Clare—and at journey’s end, we want more.""

"title : The daffodil poetry book - author : Ethel L. Fowlercategory : poetrydescription : There are many Poetry Compilations and this is one of the better ones. I have a huge collection of old books, all of which contain hidden gems, this little book, only 159 pages, is 159 pages of little gems from the wonderful William Allingham to W.B. Yeats himself. Of course if you have Allingham you have got to have Alfred Noyes, I think I have every poem of these two valuable assets to reading. The other day I had a wonderful comment about some of my old additions, mainly ones from the 19th century and wow what a great feeling.

Jemand versinkt zwischen geborstenen Eisschollen und eine Leiche baumelt von der Decke eines Theaters. Die Todesfälle liegen Jahrzehnte auseinander, doch es ist der gleiche Todestag: der 16. Januar. Im Winter 1912 ertrank Georg Heym beim Schlittschuhlaufen, 1995 werden die Novizen einer elitären Schauspielschule im gerade wiedervereinten Berlin auf sein verrätseltes Faust-Fragment angesetzt. Angestachelt von ihrem Professor verstricken sie sich immer tiefer in den Gedankenlabyrinthen des genialischen Dichters. Der psychologische Druck steigt, Konkurrenz entflammt, Wahn und Wirklichkeit beginnen zu verschwimmen. Dann wird ein Toter auf der Probebühne der Schule gefunden.

"title : The Watercourse - author : Cynthia Zarincategory : poetrydescription : In her third book of poetry, her first in eight years, Cynthia Zarin, one of the finest poets of her generation, has turned her art to fresh purposes. Taking up the subject of divorce and the splintering and re-forming of family that follows it, Zarin, whose work has been compared to that of Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, addresses the passage through a time of guilt and sorrow in an oblique yet precise tone that is unique in contemporary poetry. At the book’s center is a powerful sequence of love poems, in which she asks, “Is it light on the trees / that turns them to pale fire / or is it spring, come without / warning to this town on / stilts . . . ?” Whether taking a brood of children to the swimming pool, contemplating a parrot, or imagining a temperate landscape “where Orion / could shoot the bear along the river, and miss, and miss,” Zarin continually reveals beauty in subtle statements of feeling.  The Watercourse is a gorgeous, mature, and profoundly moving collection.   Read more Read less"

These powerful, tender, and compelling poems introduce us to a family album of marvelous and charming figures. And, in the poet's romance of the family, the intoxicating presence of the father is its profound center of gravity. Yet the poet's reverence and affection for the idea of family is inevitably troubled, we discover in later poems, by the unravelling of a marriage... Woloch's poems unveil the wreckage of love after what has been sacramental turns sacrificial. Her poems are by turns reverential, devotional and incantatory--they are prayers spoken to, and on behalf of, a difficult world"" —David St. John.   Read more Read less"

Rather than discuss the history, the politics, or the theology surrounding Jesus of Nazareth, these poems enter into the human experiences of what it might have been like to walk side-by-side on the dusty roads to Emmaus, Jericho, or Jerusalem, feeling the heat of the day while hearing what this man has to say and watching him perform simple acts of kindness as well as miracles that confounded, confused, and inspired those around him. As you read these poems, you'll also see the struggle the apostles and others felt as they tried to determine just who was this man. Enter into their amazement, hope, despair, and more as they fall in love with a man who gives them hope for a better way to live and for a better world. Enter into the minds, too, of those who opposed and betrayed him to see their struggle. Finally, read these poems as a way to connect your own humanity to Jesus' humanity, in part, to transform him from icon to flesh and blood""--Back cover.   Read more Read less"

"title : Pure act - author : Michael N. McGregorcategory : poetrydescription : ""An illuminating biography of the minimalist poet Robert Lax, a man who embraced simplicity, humility, and poverty and found the pure joy, peace and love he had long sought. Pure Act tells the story of poet Robert Lax, whose quest to live a true life as both an artist and a spiritual seeker inspired Thomas Merton, Jack Kerouac, William Maxwell and a host of other writers, artists and ordinary people. Known in the U.S. primarily as Merton's best friend and in Europe as a daringly original avant-garde poet, Lax left behind a promising New York writing career to travel with a circus, live among immigrants in post-war Marseilles and settle on a series of remote Greek islands where he learned and recorded the simple wisdom of the local people. Born a Jew, he became a Catholic and found the authentic community he sought in Greek Orthodox fishermen and sponge divers. In his early life, as he alternated working at the New Yorker, writing screenplays in Hollywood and editing a Paris literary journal with studying philosophy, serving the poor in Harlem and living in a sanctuary high in the French Alps, Lax pursued an approach to life he called pure act--a way of living in the moment that was both spontaneous and practiced, God-inspired and self-chosen. By devoting himself to simplicity, poverty and prayer, he expanded his capacity for peace, joy and love while producing distinctive poetry of such stark beauty critics called him ""one of America's greatest experimental poets"" and ""one of the new 'saints' of the avant-garde."" Written by a writer who met Lax in Greece when he was a young seeker himself and visited him regularly over fifteen years, Pure Act is an intimate look at an extraordinary but little-known life. Much more than just a biography, it's a tale of adventure, an exploration of friendship, an anthology of wisdom, and a testament to the liberating power of living an uncommon life""--  ""A biography of experimental poet and spiritual seeker Robert Lax, who inspired Thomas Merton, Jack Kerouac and many others. Using information and stories drawn from journal entries, letters, interviews and the author's personal recollections, the book chronicles the development of Lax's distinctive poetic style and a spontaneous, spiritual approach to life he called pure act""--   Read more Read less"

In The Back Chamber, Donald Hall illuminates the evocative, iconic objects of deep memory--""a cowbell,"" ""a white stone perfectly round,"" ""a three-legged milking stool""--that serve to foreground the rich meditations on time and mortality that run through his remarkable new collection. While Hall's devoted readers will recognize many of his long-standing preoccupations--baseball, the family farm, love, sex, and friendship--what will strike them as new is the fierce, pitiless poignancy he reveals as his own life's end comes into view. The Back Chamber is far from being death-haunted but rather is lively, irreverent, sexy, hilarious, ironic, and sly--full of the life-affirming energy that has made Donald Hall one of America's most popular and enduring poets""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Boss Cupid - author : Thom Gunncategory : poetrydescription : A great poet's freshest, most provocative book.  *He dreams at the center of a closed system,    Like the prison system, or a system of love,    Where folktale, recipe, and household custom    Refer back to the maze that they are of.*    --from ""A System: PCP, or Angel Dust""  Taste and appetite are contraposed in Boss Cupid, the twelfth book of poems by the quintessential San Francisco poet, who is also the quintessential craftsman and quintessentially a love poet, though not of quintessential love.Variations on how we are ruled by our desires, these poems make a startling and eloquent gloss on wanton want, moving freely from the story of King David and Bathsheba to Arthur Rimbaud's diet to the tastes of Jeffrey Dahmer. As warm and intelligent as it is ribald and cunning, this collection of Thom Gunn's is his richest yet.   Read more Read less"
"title : The essential haiku: versions of Bashō, Buson, and Issa - author : Robert Hasscategory : poetrydescription : The Essential Haiku brings together Robert Hass s beautifully fresh translations of the three great masters of the Japanese haiku tradition: Matsuo Basho (1644-94), the ascetic and seeker, and the haiku poet most familiar to English readers; Yosa Buson (1716-83), the artist, a painter renowned for his visually expressive poetry; and Kobayashi Issa (1763-1827), the humanist, whose haiku are known for their poignant or ironic wit. Each haiku master s section of the book is prefaced with an eloquent and informative introduction by Robert Hass, followed by a selection of over 100 poems and then by other poetry or prose by the poet, including journals and nature writing. Opening with Hass s superb introductory essay on haiku, the book concludes with a section devoted to Basho s writings and conversations on poetry. The seventeen-syllable haiku form is rooted in a Japanese tradition of close observation of nature, of making poetry from subtle suggestion. Each haiku is a meditation, a centring, a crystalline moment of realisation. Reading them has a way of bringing about calm and peace within the reader. The symbolism of the seasons and the Japanese habit of mind blend together in these poems to create an alchemy of reflection that is unsurpassed in literature. Infused by its great practitioners with the spirit of Zen Buddhism, the haiku served as an example of the power of direct observation to the first generation of American modernist poets like Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams as well as an example of spontaneity and Zen alertness to the new poets of post-war America and Britain. Universal in its appeal, Robert Hass s The Essential Haiku is the definitive introduction to haiku and its greatest poets, and has been a bestseller in America for twenty years. I know that for years I didn t see how deeply personal these poems were or, to say it another way, how much they have the flavour - Basho might have said the scent - of particular human life, because I had been told and wanted to believe that haiku were never subjective. I think it was D.H. Lawrence who said the soul can get to heaven in one leap but that, if it does, it leaves a demon in its place. Better to sink down through the level of these poems - their attention to the year, their ideas about it, the particular human consciousness the poems reflect, Basho s profound loneliness and sense of suffering, Buson s evenness of temper, his love for the materials of art and for the colour and shape of things, Issa s pathos and comedy and anger - Robert Hass.

But the Quantico-trained forensic investigator is finding her skills aren't enough when a ferociously intelligent killer strikes Dublin. Themodus operandi is as perplexing as it is macabre. What connects the two seemingly disparate, high-profile victims? Their corpses refuse to give up their secrets and the crime scenes prove a forensic investigator's worst nightmare. Reilly soon suspects that she may be dealing with a killer--or killers-- who know all about crime scene investigation. The police are just as frustrated by the crimes' impenetrable nature and it's only when a third murder occurs--equally graphic and elaborate in its execution--that they discover that this particular killer is using a very specific blueprint for his crimes. Who is the killer's next victim, the real target? And what's his endgame?   Read more Read less"

"title : The waste land and other writings - author : T. S. Eliotcategory : poetrydescription : First published in 1922, ""The Waste Land"" is T.S. Eliot's masterpiece, and is not only one of the key works of modernism but also one of the greatest poetic achievements of the twentieth century.  A richly allusive pilgrimage of spiritual and psychological torment and redemption, Eliot's poem exerted a revolutionary influence on his contemporaries, summoning forth a rich new poetic language, breaking decisively with Romantic and Victorian poetic traditions.  Kenneth Rexroth was not alone in calling Eliot ""the representative poet of the time, for the same reason that Shakespeare and Pope were of theirs.  He articulated the mind of an epoch in words that seemed its most natural expression.""As influential as his verse, T.S. Eliot's criticism also exerted a transformative effect on twentieth-century letter, and this new edition of The Waste Land and Other Writings includes a selection of Eliot's most important essays. In her new Introduction, Mary Karr dispels some of the myths of the great poem's inaccessibility and sheds fresh light on the ways in which ""The Waste Land"" illuminates contemporary experience.From the Hardcover edition.

"title : Cantos populares de mi tierra - author : Candelario Obesocategory : poetrydescription : A mediados de 1877, en Bogota, Obeso publico en un pequeno y sencillo volumen sus Cantos populares de mi tierra, con un prologo titulado “Dos palabras”, escrito por Venancio Gonzalez Manrique, erudito en lenguas antiguas y modernas y autor de varias obras didacticas. La obra consta de dieciseis poesias y de una version en prosa. De las catorce composiciones que llevan dedicatoria, trece estan dirigidas a escritores e intelectuales o amigos distinguidos del poeta y la otra, a una mujer identificada solamente con las iniciales S. G. L.La obra de Candelario Obeso se enmarca en lo que se ha denominado por parte de los criticos como poesia negra, poesia negrista, poesia negroide, poesia mulata, poesia afrocubana y poesia afroantillana, para mencionar los nombres mas conocidos. En general, los criticos han usado estas denominaciones para referirse a la tendencia hispanoamericana iniciada en las Antillas y derivada de los movimientos de vanguardia y del gusto por lo negro que caracterizaban la literatura y el arte europeos posteriores a la primera guerra mundial, librada entre 1914 y 1918.Los Cantos populares de mi tierra estan construidos con versos cortos, de ocho o menos silabas, de tono ligero y vivo, que prestan al poema la espontaneidad del habla y la vitalidad dinamica de la vida, rasgos caracteristicos de la poesia de Candelario Obeso. La aparicion en la Bogota de la epoca de un libro de poesias en las que el negro costeno —humilde pero orgulloso—, se expresa de si mismo y de sus inquietudes amorosas, sus preocupaciones sociales, su sabiduria popular y sus sentimientos patrioticos, no causo mucha sensacion editorial. Como es de suponer, en su inmensa mayoria los poetas y escritores colombianos no eran ni negros ni mulatos ni indios, sino personas de familias procedentes de un linaje europeo y que se identificaban con la cultura espanola transplantada a America.No extrana, pues, que la vida, los valores y los sentimientos de la poblacion de ascendencia africana no fueran —especialmente en la poesia— asunto comun en la literatura colombiana. Asi, le corresponderia al poeta Candelario Obeso —negro, costeno, de cuna humilde— presentar a Colombia una imagen intima y digna del negro y comunicar —con la voz autentica de este— el dolor, el orgullo y las esperanzas del pueblo negro colombiano.En sus poesias Obeso adhiere al habla del pueblo de su tierra. Trata de captar y de comunicar la belleza, la espontaneidad, la sencillez —el espiritu— inherentes al habla popular, mediante una fiel reproduccion fonetica de ella y una reelaboracion de su contenido folclorico e imaginativo, que es como la savia del habla. De las peculiaridades linguisticas que caracterizan el habla de los personajes de los Cantos populares, varios son fenomenos bastante generalizados entre los habitantes del litoral atlantico, aunque tienden mas a ser caracteristicas de las clases obreras y campesinas que de las capas altas y educadas. A esta habla inculta se la identifica con los grupos negroides, en cuyos ascendientes africanos se origino, debido a las adaptaciones y modificaciones foneticas que tuvieron que hacer al aprender a llevarse bien con una lengua que no les era familiar y que guardaba poca semejanza con las propias.La obra de Candelario Obeso destaca por su originalidad, el profundo sentido de amor a las virtudes de su raza y un acendrado valor estetico y filosofico que lo hacen merecedor de un lugar desatacado en la bibliografia colombiana.

"title : The making of a poem - author : Mark Strandcategory : poetrydescription : In the words of its editors, Mark Strand and Eavan Boland, The Making of a Poem ""looks squarely at some of the headaches and mysteries of poetic form."" Here, two of our foremost poets provide a lucid, straightforward anthology for those who have always felt that an understanding of form -- sonnet, ballad, villanelle, sestina, etc. -- would enhance their appreciation of poetry. By example and explanation, the anthology traces ""the exuberant history of forms,"" a history that unites poets as manifold as John Keats and Joy Harjo (the Ode) or Geoffrey Chaucer and Jean Toomer (the Stanza). Each chapter is devoted to one form, offering explanation, close reading, and a rich selection of exemplars that amply demonstrate the power and possibility of the form. In the end, Strand and Boland write, ""we hope that the reader will agree that these forms are -- as we believe -- not locks, but keys."" In linking the expressive potential of a poem to its architecture of syllable and rhyme, this collection is as instructive for the novice as it is inspiring for the practiced poet. - Jacket flap.

"title : Grace Notes - author : Rita Dovecategory : poetrydescription : With this her fourth book of poems, Rita Dove expands her role as a leading voice in contemporary American letters.  The title of the collection serves as an umbrella for the intimate concerns expressed in the forty-eight poems; in music, grace notes are those added to the basic melody, the embellishments that—if played or sung at the right moment with just the right touch—can break your heart.  Isn't this what every lyric poem wishes to be, the poet asks as she explored autobiographical events, most from childhood and the cusp of adolescence, and then turns to the shadowy areas of regret and memory. The word as talisman is another of her concerns, and finally, in the section that most typifies the lilt of grace notes, Dove considers the embellishments below the melody of daily life.

"title : Door in the Mountain - author : Jean Valentinecategory : poetrydescription : Winner of the National Book Award in Poetry (2004)  Since the 1965 publication of her first book, Dream Barker, selected for the Yale Younger Poets Award, Jean Valentine has published eight collections of poetry to critical acclaim. Spare and intensely-felt, Valentine’s poems present experience as only imperfectly graspable. This volume gathers together all of Valentine’s published poems and includes a new collection, “Door in the Mountain.”  Valentine's poetry is as recognizable as the slant truth of a dream. She is a brave, unshirking poet who speaks with fire on the great subjects—love, and death, and the soul. Her images—strange, canny visions of the unknown self—clang with the authenticity of real experience. This is an urgent art that wants to heal what it touches, a poetry that wants to tell, intimately, the whole life.   Read more Read less"
"title : Nothing to declare - author : Henri Colecategory : poetrydescription : ""A bold new collection of poems of feral beauty and intense vulnerability The poems in Henri Cole's ninth book, Nothing to Declare, explore life and need and delight. Each poem starts up from its own unique occasion and is then conducted through surprising (sometimes unnerving) and self-steadying domains. The result is a daring, delicate, unguarded, and tender collection. After his last three books--Touch, Blackbird and Wolf, and Middle Earth--in which the sonnet was a thrown shape and not merely a template, Cole's buoyant new poems seem trim and terse, with a first-place, last-ditch resonance. In their sorrowful richness, they combine a susceptibility to sensuousness and an awareness of desolation. With precise reliability of detail, a supple wealth of sound, and a speculative truthfulness, Cole transforms the pain of experience into the keen pleasure of expressive language. Nothing to Declare is a rare work, necessary and durable, light in touch but with just enough weight to mark the soul""--  ""A new collection of poems from the author of Touch and Middle Earth""--   Read more Read less"
"title : At the foundling hospital - author : Robert Pinskycategory : poetrydescription : """"Since the death of Robert Lowell in 1977, no single figure has dominated American poetry the way that Lowell, or before him Eliot, once did. But among the many writers who have come of age in our fin de siècle, none have succeeded more completely as poet, critic, and translator than Robert Pinsky.""--James Longenbach, The Nation. The poems in Robert Pinsky's At the Foundling Hospital consider personality and culture as improvised from loss: a creative effort so pervasive it is invisible. An extreme example is the abandoned newborn. At the Foundling Hospital of eighteenth-century London, in a benign and oddly bureaucratic process, each new infant was identified by a duly recorded token. A minimal, charged particle of meaning, the token might be a coin or brooch or thimble--or sometimes a poem, such as the one quoted in full in Pinsky's poem ""The Foundling Tokens."" A foundling may inherit less of a past than an orphan, but with a wider set of meanings. The foundling soul needs to be adopted, and it needs to be adaptive. In one poem, French and German appear as originally Creole tongues, invented by the rough needs of conquered peoples and their Roman masters. In another, creators from scorned or excluded groups--among them Irving Berlin, Quintus Horatius Flaccus, and W.E.B. Du Bois--speak, as does the Greek tragic chorus, in the first-person singular. In these poems, a sometimes desperate, perpetual reimagining of identity, on the scale of one life or of human history, is deeply related to music: The quest is lyrical, whether the subject is as specific as ""the emanation of a dead star still alive"" or as personal as the ""pinhole iris of your mortal eye.""

"title : Sir Gawain and the Green Knight - author : W. S. Merwincategory : poetrydescription : A splendid new translation of the classic Arthurian tale of enchantment, adventure, and romance, presented alongside the original Middle English text.It is the height of Christmas and New Year's revelry when an enormous knight with brilliant green clothes and skin descends upon King Arthur's court. He presents a sinister challenge: he will endure a blow of the axe to his neck without offering any resistance, but whoever gives the blow must promise to take the same in exactly a year and a day's time. The young Sir Gawain quickly rises to the challenge, and the poem tells of the adventures he finds--an almost irresistible seduction, shockingly brutal hunts, and terrifyingly powerful villains--as he endeavors to fulfill his promise.Capturing the pace, impact, and richly alliterative language of the original text, W. S. Merwin has imparted a new immediacy to a spellbinding narrative, written centuries ago by a poet whose name is now unknown, lost to time. Of the Green Knight, Merwin notes in his foreword: ""We seem to recognize him--his splendor, the awe that surrounds him, his menace and his grace--without being able to place him . . . We will never know who the Green Knight is except in our own response to him.""From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less"

"title : The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - author : Omar Khayyamcategory : poetrydescription : Edward FitzGerald gave the title The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam to his translation of poetry attributed to the Persian poet, astronomer and mathematician Omar Khayyam (1048-1123). The word ""Rubaiyat"" means quatrains - verses of four lines. These works by Fitzgerald are the best known English translations. This edition contains both the first and fifth editions of the Rubaiyat. This influential translation is seen by many as a zenith of English literature in the nineteenth century. Fitzgerald states that his translation ""will interest you from its form, and also in many respects in its detail: very unliteral as it is. Many quatrains are mashed together: and something lost, I doubt, of Omar's simplicity, which is so much a virtue in him."" And, ""I suppose very few People have ever taken such Pains in Translation as I have: though certainly not to be literal. But at all Cost, a Thing must live: with a transfusion of one's own worse Life if one can't retain the Original's better. Better a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle.""   Read more Read less"

"title : Fresh News from the Arctic - author : Libby Hartcategory : poetrydescription : Resonant and delicate, Fresh News from the Arctic offers a finely wrought sensibility which elevates the subtle topography of life’s quiet events. This is a collection that investigates the human experience, parting the veil of the mundane to reveal passion, beauty, myth and mystery. At once atmospheric, with a surreal blend of emotion and memory, Fresh News from the Arctic is a fluid and ever-shifting landscape of possibilities. These poems are restless and inquisitive.

"title : Starkey's Book of States - author : David Starkeycategory : poetrydescription : From North Dakota, where “emptiness / takes up a lot / of space,” to Alabama, where a mother offers “nothing / Less than plenty,” David Starkey’s poems mark him as nothing less than a “fool / For life.” His book gives us a fireworks display of creativity as varied and strange as the states it conjures. We scoot along here in a word-RV bound for just about everywhere, from North Carolina, which possesses, so Starkey claims, an atomic peanut (while Texas doesn’t, but provides blowing sage) to D. C., memorable for kids in the backseat who won’t shut up, to Connecticut centered on “publish or perish” at Yale.  The wonders here depend on constant shifts of focus: sometimes the poems inhabit personae—Thoreau, Sojourner Truth, Elvis (not in Tennessee but in Wisconsin)—sometimes they speak for the poet as memoir; always they surprise and thrill with their oddity of attack, their tart-voiced fearlessness, their range of subject as vast as the great country they so fully evoke.  —Barry Spacks, Santa Barbara Poet LaureateThe book is illustrated by Rafael Perea de la Cabada   Read more Read less"

His lyrical poetry, though containing many Classical allusions, is fresh and simple. The author of many love poems, he writes advice to virgins and descriptions of the type of mistress he desires.John Donne, in contrast to Herrick, is the type of poet who married the woman he loved even though it meant having to go to jail because of his disapproving father-in-law. Writing most of his evocative love poems in the 1950s, the decade before his marriage, his poems are full of aching passion.   Read more Read less"
"title : Collected Poems - author : Patrick Kavanaghcategory : poetrydescription : The centenary of Patrick Kavanagh's birth in 2004 provides the ideal opportunity to reappraise one of modern Ireland's greatest poets. From a harsh, humble background that he himself described so brilliantly, Kavanagh burst through immense constraints to redefine Irish poetry - a poetry appropriate for a fully independent country, both politically and culturally. Moving beyond Irish verse's preoccupation with history, national politics and identity, he turned to the land and scenery of his native Inniskeen, portraying the closely-observed minutiae of everyday rural and urban life in an uninhibited, groundbreaking style. Lucid, various, direct and engaging, Kavanagh's poems have a unique place in the canon and a unique accessibility.This major new edition is the culmination of many years of work by Antoinette Quinn in creating authoritative texts for Kavanagh's poetry - from his early works such as 'Inniskeen Road: July Evening' to his masterpiece, the epic 'The Great Hunger', allowing us to see the development of Kavanagh's genius as never before.

"title : Stanzas in meditation: and other poems, 1929-1933. - author : Gertrude Steincategory : poetrydescription : Written in 1932 at the house that Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas had rented in the Rhone Valley, Stanzas in Meditation is one of Stein's most abstract and complex works. It is almost as if Stanzas was conceived as a mirror opposite of The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, penned in the same year. The latter, written in a more direct and normative language, brought Stein international acclaim and resulted in the attention she received from 1934 on, while the former remained unavailable until its publication, after her death, in 1956. To Stein readers and admirers, however, this is one of her most important works, a poetic achievement central to her canon. From John Ashbery's groundbreaking essay-review of Stanzas in 1957 to Richard Bridgman's 1970 publication, Gertrude Stein in Pieces, poets and critics have recognized the importance of this masterpiece.

The poems in his new collection approach questions of suffering and atrocity (e.g., war, genocide, fallen souffles) with discerning humor and unconventional comedy. These poems show how humor can be taken as seriously as straight-ahead solemnity and how we can re-envision solemnity in terms other than lamentation, protest, and memorial.   Read more Read less"

"title : Walks: A Collection of Haiku - author : Cendrine Marrouatcategory : poetrydescription : Haiku are unrhymed poems consisting of about 17 syllables spread over three lines. This poetry form started in Japan and has been very popular in many countries around the world for decades.  Haiku force you to be concise. They teach you impactfulness. As such, they are the embodiment of the ""Show don't tell"" technique. A technique that allows readers to experience stories in a more personal and meaningful manner.  ""Walks: A Collection of Haiku (Volume 1)"" is not just a celebration of Cendrine Marrouat’s love for haiku. It is also an invitation to enjoy the flitting moments that make life beautiful...  Book available at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07....  Advance reviews:  ""While reading I felt like the author took my hand and whispered to me 'come, let me show you the things you are not seeing with true sight'."" - Natalie Brown (Musician, Vlogger & Entrepreneur)  ""Cendrine’s thoughts are lifted constantly by her keen eye for detail, her interactions with her environment and even how she observes the very elements themselves. She distils each scene that plays out in her haiku snapshots with emotional punch, verve and fierce purity of purpose."" - David Ellis (Award Winning Author of 'Life, Sex & Death – A Poetry Collection')  ""I loved 'Walks: A Collection of Haiku (Volume 1)' for the same reason I love Haiku in general…  To “get” Cendrine’s haiku as for all, you have to stop racing…slow down…read it thought by thought – image by image…pause…contemplate. Each haiku is a time for time to stand still, while your heart and soul touch the moment."" - Lynne McAnulty-Street (Editor and Publishing Consultant at Red Penn Services Ltd)  ""'Walks: A Collection of Haiku (Volume 1)' takes us to a new dimension, but in the world we live in. It captures the true essence of life and feelings. With new eyes. Minimalist, but great, and strong. A new look into details we often lack to see. Or feel. The precious little things that surround us. And the greatest. It awakes the magic and the dreams.  This writing freezes the moments. Like photography does. Moments we can cherish and keep warmly in our heart.  Cendrine’s haiku are the best I’ve read so far. I strongly recommend the book to everyone."" - Isabel Nolasco (Photographer)  ""Haiku are traditionally difficult to write in a meaningful way, because most writers are limited by the rules of the form. Not Marrouat. She uses the form like a master, crafting her own word combinations to dance within the beats of the Haiku."" - Katrina Moody (Writer & Editor)   Read more Read less"

"title : Prayers of a Heretic: Poems - author : Yermiyahu Ahron Taubcategory : poetrydescription : Prayers of a Heretic explores the ""crime"" of heresy and the condition of existential displacement through the language of prayer and prayerful voice/s. In the first section, ""Visits and Visitations,"" the poet imagines a variety of protoganists in situations of supplication. The second section, ""In the Gleaning,"" examines the life, trangressions, and prayers of the title character and the primacy of books, libraries, and reading for refuge and reconfiguration. Eschewing a secular/religious divide, the book offers an expansive interpretation of the enduring power of prayer. Four poems also have a Yiddish version.  ———  A hiss. An incantation. Fevered kisses. The heretical. In Prayers of a Heretic, Yermiyahu Ahron Taub sings of the daily, domestic, of the fleshy and the mortal. Listen to these words—dirge, meditation, celebration. Through them, Taub brings us closer to being human and to the divine.    —Julie R. Enszer, author of Handmade Love  Piety has a bad name these days.  But in these lyrical wrestlings with the flesh and the spirit, Yermiyahu Ahron Taub reminds us that the pious are often the most passionate, and the heretics often the most holy.    —Dr. Jay Michaelson, author of Another Word for Sky: Poems  Taub is a master of the character study. His poems are crowded with portraits, novels in miniature, of the old, the overlooked, the dispossessed.  Here you will find Aunt Milkah Pesl, taciturn and unsentimental, the volunteer in assisted living who reads books in Yiddish, the patient in an MRI scanner listening to ""a symphony of terror"" like ""John Zorn on Quaaludes."" There are the regulars in a library, and the treasures found hidden in the pages of old books.  There are lonely men in search of ""fleshly glory.""  And over-arching all, there are repentance and atonement, constantly remade anew.    —Kim Roberts, author of Pearl Poetry Prize-winning Animal Magnetism  This book is a feast: sensuous, ironic, political, hilarious, poignant and wise. Intimately Jewish yet embracing of all, its cast of characters includes aged professors, flirtatious landladies, poem-peddlers and the Pied Piper. In ""Credo,"" a stunning poem near the book's end, Taub powerfully defines religion on his own terms, with equal measures of awe, horror and gratitude at the world.    —Ruth L. Schwartz, author of Edgewater  Whether he's writing in English or Yiddish, in poetry or prayer, Yermiyahu Ahron Taub has a firm grasp on the language of the heart. His characters, men (including one named Yermiyahu) and women whose only crimes are that they are human, are as familiar as our own reflections. In Taub's skilled and attentive hands, no judgments are passed; heresy is in the eye of the beholder.    —Gregg Shapiro, author of GREGG SHAPIRO: 77 and Protection  Prayers of a Heretic chronicles the physical and spiritual dimensions on which life itself depends.  In a word: shelter.  When observed by a poet with Taub's skill and generosity, the acts of seeking, erecting and sustaining shelter become memorably praiseworthy.  Readers will be moved by much in this collection, including the sleeping homeless woman in the library ""who surely traversed the city in storm and sun""; and the unnamed schoolchildren, ""united by navy blue knee socks,"" carefully educated at a religious school (""the palace of certainty shielding the unknowable"").  We aver what Taub avers: ""there is no time assigned for prayer the sanctuary never closes.""     —Kevin Simmonds, author of Mad for Meat  Visit the author's website at http://www.yataub.net/home.html  Categories:    Poetry: General    Poetry: Queer Studies    Poetry : Inspirational & Religious    Social Science : Jewish Studies   Read more Read less"

"title : Poems from Ish River Country - author : Robert Sundcategory : poetrydescription : ""Poems from Ish River Country collects the complete poems of poet, painter, and calligrapher Robert Sund. His few published volumes of poetry and frequent public readings established his reputation as one of the most distinctive poetic voices of the Pacific Northwest, where he enjoyed a tremendous popularity. His short, imagistic poems, in the tradition of William Carlos Williams and Kenneth Rexroth, distill the essence of the Northwest landscape and in plain speech celebrate themes of family, friendship, work and quiet contemplation. Included here are the poet's award-winning collections, Bunch Grass, which gave literary voice to the rolling wheat country east of the Cascade Mountains in his native Washington State, and Ish River, which celebrated the misty river landscape of the Puget Sound country, a place, in the poet's words, 'between two mountain ranges where many rivers run down to an inland sea.' But the great part of this collection contains poems unpublished during the poet's lifetime or published only in very limited editions. There is also a generous selection of his translations, from Issa, Buson, Basho, and most especially from the Swedish poet Rabbe Enckell, with whom Sund felt a close affinity. This collection was originally published by Shoemaker & Hoard, and Pleasure Boat Studio is extremely proud to be making it available again.""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Subject of Crusade - author : Marisa Galvezcategory : poetrydescription : ""Marisa Galvez challenges received ideas about medieval lyric poetry and Arthurian romance at a time when terms like ""crusade,"" ""medieval,"" and ""holy war"" continue to be tossed about unexamined in popular media in relation to Islamist fundamentalism. ""The Subject of Crusade"" offers a more complex view of crusade and holy war, arguing that vernacular crusade lyric and romance of the twelfth through fourteenth centuries and related visual artworks of the fifteenth century can tell us a different story if we read them as literary texts as much as historical documents. Placing chronicles and knightly handbooks in conversation with confessional and pastoral texts, she identifies a ""crusade idiom"" that emerged out of a conflict between what European poet/crusaders saw as their pious duty as Christian soldiers, on the one hand, and their earthly duties toward their clans, on the other. How, Galvez asks, does a Christian soldier articulate a sincere intention to go on a crusade while responsibilities toward family and fields at home intervene? Put another way: How does one affirm an intention to physically suffer in Syria in order to help save the Holy Land? Or how do courtly concerns differ for a Frankish knight in faraway Cyprus versus a lord in the relative security of Champagne? By placing crusade love lyric and romances in dialogue with pastoral and confessional documents, Galvez is able to read the conventions and tropes across genres usually kept separate as writers and artists respond to historical and moral problems of the day. The book gives a different picture of how lay people of the period thought about crusading""--   Read more Read less"

"title : FOOLISH/UNFOOLISH - author : Ashanti Douglascategory : poetrydescription : Foolish/Unfoolish is a collection of vibrant and honest ""reflections on love"" by R&B singer Ashanti. Ever since she was thirteen years old, Ashanti has kept journals of her poetry, thoughts, and ideas about life and love. Now, in this very personal collection, Ashanti presents her poems about love, along with stories about what (or who) moved her to write them. In Foolish/Unfoolish, Ashanti explores such universal themes as falling head-over-heels in love, becoming insanely jealous, feeling broken-hearted, and being single but having hope for the future. In ""No Words,"" she describes being completely addicted to a new boyfriend; in ""Ride Out,"" she captures what it feels like to be joyriding with your man on a hot summer night; in ""Insecure,"" she writes about telling a suspicious boyfriend to stop driving by her house at night to see if her car is there; and in ""Us,"" she delves into the pain of discovering that your man is cheating on you. Spirited, moving and often filled with humor, Ashanti’s poetry and reflections will entertain and surprise as they offer an intimate look into the life of one of today’s most popular performers. These are works that are both lyrical and raw and which tell the truth about love.   Read more Read less"

"title : Poetry will save your life - author : Jill Bialoskycategory : poetrydescription : An unconventional and inventive coming-of-age memoir organized around forty-three remarkable poems by poets such as Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens and Sylvia Plath, from a critically acclaimed New York Times bestselling author and poet. For Jill Bialosky, certain poems stand out like signposts at pivotal moments in a life: the death of a father, adolescence, first love, leaving home, the suicide of a sister, marriage, the birth of a child, the day in New York City the Twin Towers fell. As Bialosky narrates these moments, she illuminates the ways in which particular poems offered insight, compassion, and connection, and shows how poetry can be a blueprint for living. In Poetry Will Save Your Life,  Bialosky recalls when she encountered each formative poem, and how its importance and meaning evolved over time, allowing new insights and perceptions to emerge. While Bialosky's personal stories animate each poem, they touch on many universal experiences, from the awkwardness of girlhood, to crises of faith and identity, from braving a new life in a foreign city to enduring the loss of a loved one, from becoming a parent to growing creatively as a poet and artist. In Poetry Will Save Your Life, Bialosky has crafted an engaging and entirely original examination of a life while celebrating the enduring value of poetry, not as a purely cerebral activity, but as a means of conveying personal experience and as a source of comfort and intimacy. In doing so she brilliantly illustrates the ways in which poetry can be an integral part of life itself and can, in fact, save your life. --Amazon   Read more Read less"

"title : Songs, sacred and devotional - author : H. O. Fostercategory : poetrydescription : Preface     the influences which, during the last half century,have modified the rigor of the prevailing creed of christendom have not been few nor fleeting. Theology has relaxed its grim features. and tacitly abandoned or put out of sight, one by one tenets at variance with the advanced intelligence and religious sentiment of the age. The Poets have, with some exceptions, been in advance of the theologians in giving us ideas of providence and a future life, consistent with the wants and analogies of our nature, and not a variance with the teachings of revelation. Poetry, from the time of Job, has been the mother tongue of devotion and prophecy; and the poets, in their highest moods, have generally been true to those inmost assurances of the soul, which represent a God and an after-life in keeping with our best ideas of omnipotent benignity and love. It will require but a casual glance to see that this is no sectarian book. It will have fulfilled its mission if it help to indicate that the highest human conceptions of the Beautiful and the True are in accordance with the faith which, in the spirit of Christ's teaching, can sincerely and consistently address the Omnipotent as ""our Father,"" And which can look through death in the serene assurance that He "" doeth all things well,"" and that justice will, in this and every future stage of being, be ever tempered with mercy.

"title : Arts of the Possible - author : Adrienne Richcategory : poetrydescription : These essays trace a distinguished writer's engagement with her time, her arguments with herself and others. ""I am a poet who knows the social power of poetry, a United States citizen who knows herself irrevocably tangled in her society's hopes, arrogance, and despair,"" Adrienne Rich writes.  The essays in Arts of the Possible search for possibilities beyond a compromised, degraded system, seeking to imagine something else. They call on the fluidity of the imagination, from poetic vision to social justice, from the badlands of political demoralization to an art that might wound, that may open scars when engaged in its work, but will finally suture and not tear apart. This volume collects Rich's essays from the last decade of the twentieth century, including four earlier essays, as well as several conversations that go further than the usual interview. Also included is her essay explaining her reasons for declining the National Medal for the Arts.   Read more Read less"

Archeophonics, defined as the archeology of lost sound, is one way of understanding the role and the task of poetry: to recover the buried sounds and shapes of languages in the tradition of the art, and the multitude of private connections that lie undisclosed in one's emotional memory. The book takes seriously the opening epigraph by the late great James Schuyler: ""poetry, like music, is not just song."" It recognizes that the poem is not a decorative art object but a means of organizing the world, in the words of anthropologist Clifford Geertz, ""into transient examples of shaped behavior."" Archeophonics is a series of discrete poems that are linked by repeated phrases and words, and its themes are nothing less than joy, outrage, loss, transhistorical thought, and day-to-day life. It is a private book of public and civic concerns.--Amazon.com.   Read more Read less"

"title : Calling a wolf a wolf - author : Kaveh Akbarcategory : poetrydescription : ""'The struggle from late youth on, with and without God, agony, narcotics and love is a torment rarely recorded with such sustained eloquence and passion as you will find in this collection.' -Fanny Howe. This highly-anticipated debut boldly confronts addiction and courses the strenuous path of recovery, beginning in the wilds of the mind. Poems confront craving, control, the constant battle of alcoholism and sobriety, and the questioning of the self and its instincts within the context of this never-ending fight. From 'Stop Me If You've Heard This One Before': Sometimes you just have to leave whatever's real to you, you have to clomp through fields and kick the caps off all the toadstools. Sometimes you have to march all the way to Galilee or the literal foot of God himself before you realize you've already passed the place where you were supposed to die. I can no longer remember the being afraid, only that it came to an end. Kaveh Akbar is the founding editor of Divedapper. His poems appear recently or soon in The New Yorker, Poetry, APR, Tin House, PBS NewsHour, and elsewhere. He is the author of the chapbook Portrait of the Alcoholic (Sibling Rivalry). The recipient of a 2016 Ruth Lilly and Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Fellowship from the Poetry Foundation and the Lucille Medwick Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America, Akbar was born in Tehran, Iran, and currently lives and teaches in Florida""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Carver, a Life in Poems - author : Marilyn Nelsoncategory : poetrydescription : George Washington Carver was born a slave in Missouri about 1864 and was raised by the childless white couple who had owned his mother. In 1877 he left home in search of an education, eventually earning a master's degree. In 1896, Booker T. Washington invited Carver to start the agricultural department at the all-black-staffed Tuskegee Institute, where he spent the rest of his life seeking solutions to the poverty among landless black farmers by developing new uses for soil-replenishing crops such as peanuts, cowpeas, and sweet potatoes. Carver's achievements as a botanist and inventor were balanced by his gifts as a painter, musician, and teacher. This Newbery Honor Book and Coretta Scott King Author Honor Book by Marilyn Nelson provides a compelling and revealing portrait of Carver's complex, richly interior, profoundly devout life.

"title : Heaven - author : Rowan Ricardo Phillipscategory : poetrydescription : ""A spectacularly vibrant and continually surprising collection from one of the poetry world's rising young stars ""Who the hell's heaven is this?"" Rowan Ricardo Phillips offers many answers, and none at all, in Heaven, the piercing and revelatory encore to his award-winning debut, The Ground. Swerving elegantly from humor to heartbreak, from Colorado to Florida, from Dante's Paradise to Homer's Illiad, from knowledge to ignorance to awe, Phillips turns his gaze upward and outward, probing and upending notions of the beyond. ""Feeling, real feeling / with all its faulty / Architecture, is / Beyond a god's touch""--but it does not elude Phillips. Meditating on feverish boyhood, on two paintings by Chuck Close, on Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, on a dead rooster by the side of the road in Ohio, on an elk grazing outside his window, his language remains eternally intoxicating, full of play, pathos, and surprise. ""The end,"" he writes, ""like / All I've ever told you, is uncertain."" Or, elsewhere: ""The only way then to know a truth / Is to squint in its direction and poke."" Phillips--who received a 2013 Whiting Writers' Award as well as the PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award--may not be certain, but as he squints and pokes in the direction of truth, his power of perception and elegance of expression create a place where beauty and truth come together and drift apart like a planet orbiting its star. The result is a book whose lush and wounding beauty will leave its mark on readers long after they've turned the last page""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Poesía en paralelo cero - author : Pedro Rosa Baldacategory : poetrydescription : La rapidéz  Entre la séptima y Ia octava edición del Paralelo cero 2015 y 2016, respectivamente han pasado solamente nueve meses. Además que han sido unos meses difíciles: hemos estado huyendo de los compromisos fuera de Ia poesía y eso que la ""tarea poética"" nos puntualiza siempre sus planes, mientras nosotros seguimos soñando, seguimos buscando que alguien nos ayude, que alguien nos de la mano, que no nos dejen ahogarnos en las arenosas piedras de la burocracia cultural. Por suerte hemos ganado por cuarta ocasión, ya, el Fondo de Festivales del Ministerio de Cultura del Ecuador. Esto es prácticamente lo que nos hace estar vivos este año. Llegamos al número ocho casi sin aliento y casi al mismo tiempo del anterior. Literalmente, antes de acabar con el séptimo encuentro teníamos ya la lista del octavo. La vida de algunos de nosotros es casi dependiente del ""Paralelo Cero"", la organizamos pensando en ese cronograma: hermosa magia vital Ia de vivir auscultando la poesía en nuestra lengua para dársela de comer al habitante promedio de nuestro mundillo literario y decirle a cada momento que creemos en Ia poesía, que creemos en Ia vida, que creemos en el arte y que creemos... (Léase la época de crisis a la hora de creer en cualquier cosa). Pero, para algunos, eso es como ver llover. No es nada. Y nada es nada.  La gente sigue diciendo que qué bonito es esto del poema, que qué lindos los poetas, que qué maravilla el trabajo de la gestión literaria, que qué preciosidad ver ese empuje, esa labor, esa tenacidad, esa valentía. Pero luego, lueguito no mas, el discurso de siempre: ""ahorita sí que no se puede"", ""ahorita sí que es bien difícil"", ""ahora mismo no podría ser"", ""ahorita vino a visitarnos la crisis"", ""ahora mismo estamos hecho pedazos"", ""en este momento si que no se puede porque han venido a vernos los heraldos negros, esos de Vallejo, esos mismos, han venido. Que qué duro esta, que qué terrible esta, que qué monstruoso esta. Pero, por el otro lado, que qué lindo esta que trabajes en/con/para/ por Ia poesía. Tal vez te podamos ayudar con, por ejemplo... publico; con, por ejemplo, aplausos; con por ejemplo, barras; con por ejemplo, ánimos; con, por ejemplo, un me gusta en Facebook; con, por ejemplo, una foto compartida; con, por ejemplo, una sonrisita para la selfie; con alguito hemos de apoyar. Aunque, la verdad sea dicha —dicen- no me gusta Ia poesía y, además, que también será: a mí me gusta el arte más cache, más nice, más in, más cool, más fashion. A mí me gusta el arte más de Messi, a mi me gusta el arte más de museo de banco. A mí me gusta el arte así de Teatro bien puesto, de Opera, pero un poco alas cantada, como te diré, de operita, de operita, así de, como te diré, de operar no más mi pc para ver si sale algo bonito, alg6n dibujito, alguna cosita. Ese arte es el mío, porque Ia poesía es bien difícil, ve; bien complicada: yo me acuerdo en el colegio con los poetas Decapitados, que eran unos capos, pero que dolor, oye; que tortura, oye; que tristeza, oye; que melancólicos esos manes, oye. Razón se mataron. ¿Y vos no te vas a matar? No creo no, porque vos ya eres más moderno, vos ya eres más de otra onda, no ve. Vos ya no eres como esos manes. Yo, lo que si prefiero son los pasillos, pero solo cuando ""chupo"". Se siente pleno estar alcoholizado, mientras se escucha esos pasillos de J.J que, según dicen, no han sido ni pasillos, ni ecuatorianos, como nuestra hermosa y popular ""No puedo verte triste porque me matas/ tu carita de pena mi dulce amor..."", dicen que es bolero y que no es escrita por aquí, pero igual eso es poesía, ele.  Cuando uno se siente estar solo y caminar solo, entonces le queda la compañía de la misma poesía. La sombra del poema adentrándose en uno. Saber que los poetas son unos cómplices. La fe que tengo en la poesía es Ia misma que tienen millones en las vírgenes y los santos, en las nubes, en las cosechas, en las herencia, en las tías ricas, en los hijos triunfadores, en los divorcios, en las tierras des-habitadas, en los nuevos amigos, en las canciones nuevas del artista que aman o en el amor a secas.  Con Ia misma rapidez con la que me juego las tardes para trabajar por la poesía, con esa misma atracción, con ese mismo desafío, estamos aquí otro año más para enseñarle al mundo que, pese a todo seguimos siendo amigos de lo imposible.

After her father died in the mines and her mother ran off, he was her last caretaker. They'd always dreamed of leaving Caboose, West Virginia together someday, but instead she's in foster care, feeling more stuck and broken than ever. But then hen Sasha discovers family she didn't know she had, and she finally has something to hold onto, especially sweet little Mikey, who's just as broken as she is. Sasha even makes her first friend at school, and is slowly learning to cope with her brother's death through writing poetry, finding a new way to express herself when spoken words just won't do. But when tragedy strikes the mine her cousin works in, Sasha fears the worst and takes Mikey and runs, with no plans to return. In this sensitive and poignant portrayal, Sarah Dooley shows us that life, like poetry, doesn’t always take the form you intend."" --   Read more Read less"

"title : October mourning - author : Lesléa Newmancategory : poetrydescription : On the night of October 6, 1998, a gay twenty-one-year-old college student named Matthew Shepard was kidnapped from a Wyoming bar by two young men, savagely beaten, tied to a remote fence, and left to die. Gay Awareness Week was beginning at the University of Wyoming, and the keynote speaker was Lesléa Newman, discussing her book Heather Has Two Mommies. Shaken, the author addressed the large audience that gathered, but she remained haunted by Matthew’s murder. October Mourning, a novel in verse, is her deeply felt response to the events of that tragic day.  Using her poetic imagination, the author creates fictitious monologues from various points of view, including the fence Matthew was tied to, the stars that watched over him, the deer that kept him company, and Matthew himself. More than a decade later, this stunning cycle of sixty-eight poems serves as an illumination for readers too young to remember, and as a powerful, enduring tribute to Matthew Shepard’s life.

"title : Argonautica - author : Gaius Valerius Flaccuscategory : poetrydescription : This 1st-century AD Latin version of the earlier Greek epic features exotic lands, wondrous monsters and a sea voyage over swells of young love. Valerius Flaccus lent sharp Roman refinements and erotic passion to the tale, which are skillfully sustained in this careful and appealing modern translation in English verse.  Apollonius Rhodius’ epic poem Argonautica, written in Greek during the 3rd century BC, has become the de facto standard version of the story of Jason and the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. Valerius Flaccus’ Latin epic of the last 1st century AD is by contrast little known, even to those well-read in ancient literature. This translation offers an accurate and appealing version in English verse.  Flaccus’ Argonautica lends keen Roman touches to the tale, amplifying the sense of adventure and the erotic passion found in the Greek. It offers vicarious travel to exotic lands, gripping heroism before wondrous monsters and a dream team of famous Greek heroes. The stirring sea voyage is spiced by the blossoming love of Jason and Medea, young passion not yet gone sour. Michael Barich’s deft translation and lyrical grace notes will delight devotees and newcomers to this timeless classic.  Many know of this tale via the 1963 Columbia Pictures film, with its stop-motion animation by Ray Harryhausen.   Read more Read less"

"title : Desesperanto - author : Marilyn Hackercategory : poetrydescription : One of our strongest poets of conscience confronts the dangerous new century with intelligence, urbanity, and elegiac humor.  Marilyn Hacker's voice is unique in its intelligence, urbanity, its deployment of an elegiac humor, its weaving of literary sources into the fabric and vocabulary of ordinary life, its archaeology of memory. Desesperanto refines the themes of loss, exile, and return that have consistently informed her work. The title itself is a wordplay combining the Spanish word esperanto, signifying ""hope,"" and the French desespoir, meaning ""to lose heart."" Des-esperanto, then, is a universal language of despair ―despair of the possibility of a universal language. As always in Hacker's poetry, prosodic measure is a catalyst for profound feeling and accurate thought, and she employs it with a wit and brio that at once stem from and counteract despair. Guillaume Apollinaire, June Jordan, and Joseph Roth are among this book's tutelary spirits, to whom the poet pays homage as she confronts a new, dangerous century.   Read more Read less"

"title : Mean boy - author : Lynn Coadycategory : poetrydescription : Earnest, small-town Lawrence Campbell is fascinated by his poetry professor, the charismatic and uncompromising Jim Arsenault. Larry is determined to escape a life of thrifty drudgery and intellectual poverty working for his parents' motel and mini-golf business on Prince Edward Island. Jim appears to the young poet as a beacon of authenticity - mercurial, endlessly creative, fearless in his confrontations with the forces of conformity. And he drinks a lot.  Jim's magnetic personality soon draws Larry's entire poetry composition class into his orbit. Among the other literary acolytes are Sherrie Mitten, with her ringletted blonde hair and guileless blue eyes, the turtlenecked, urbane Claude who writes villanelles, and the champion of rhyming couplets about the heroic struggles of the Maritime proletariat, Todd. Casting a huge shadow over the group is the varsity football player and recreational drug user Chuck Slaughter - titanically strong, capriciously violent, hilariously indifferent to the charms of the poetic life - who has nearly given up terrifying Larry in order to pursue an awkward romantic interest in Sherrie.  Drawn by ambition and fascination, the group assembles itself fawningly around Jim, tagging along to bars, showing up at readings, thrilled to be invited to Jim's home, a shambling farmhouse in the woods where he lives with Moira, his shrewish backwoods muse. Lost in adulation, Larry is so delighted to be singled out for Jim's attention that he does not pause to wonder what Jim expects from his increasingly close relationship with the young poet.

"title : Connecting the Dots: Poems - author : Maxine Kumincategory : poetrydescription : In these new poems, her eleventh collection, Maxine Kumin expands on the themes that have engaged her most strongly. Family connections resurface as she imagines a letter to her mother, long dead, or assesses the shift of responsibility between generations (""...they still love us who overtake us""). Her dialogue with the natural world - especially with the narrow divide between human and animal - continues, most notably in ""Deja Vu"", where she pays homage to her personal totem, the bear. Change and the things that never change attract Kumin's attention equally. Whether chronicling the bounty of summer, the cycle of seasons, or memories of youthful parties and lost friends, her voice is wise, clear, and compelling.   Read more Read less"
"title : The Complete Poems of John Keats - author : John Keatscategory : poetrydescription : 'I think I shall be among the English Poets after my death,' John Keats soberly prophesied in 1818 as he started writing the blankverse epic Hyperion. Today he endures as the archetypal Romantic genius who explored the limits of the imagination and celebrated the pleasures of the senses but suffered a tragic early death. Edmund Wilson counted him as 'one of the half dozen greatest English writers,' and T. S. Eliot has paid tribute to the Shakespearean quality of Keats's greatness. Indeed, his work has survived better than that of any of his contemporaries the devaluation of Romantic poetry that began early in this century. This Modern Library edition contains all of Keats's magnificent verse: 'Lamia,' 'Isabella,' and 'The Eve of St. Agnes'; his sonnets and odes; the allegorical romance Endymion; and the five-act poetic tragedy Otho the Great. Presented as well are the famous posthumous and fugitive poems, including the fragmentary 'The Eve of Saint Mark' and the great 'La Belle Dame sans Merci,' perhaps the most distinguished literary ballad in the language. 'No one else in English poetry, save Shakespeare, has in expression quite the fascinating felicity of Keats, his perception of loveliness,' said Matthew Arnold. 'In the faculty of naturalistic interpretation, in what we call natural magic, he ranks with Shakespeare.'   Read more Read less"

"title : An almost pure empty walking - author : Tryfon Tolidescategory : poetrydescription : A stunning debut from the winner of the National Poetry SeriesIn his debut collection, chosen by Mary Karr as a winner of the 2005 National Poetry Series, Tryfon Tolides weaves together poems that speak of desire, loss, and small joys. Tolides was born in a tiny village in Greece and his work is rooted in the mountains and wind and the deep interior of that place; his poems express a longing and a searching for peace, for home, for beauty, for escape. These poems constitute a lament, whether they concern themselves with the difficulties of assimilation or the question of whether it is possible for people to live with one another in a spirit of true understanding. They prove that the physical and the metaphysical can share residence, can even be one and the same.   Read more Read less"

"title : The roominghouse madrigals: early selected poems, 1946-1966 - author : Charles Bukowskicategory : poetrydescription : Charles Bukowski is one of America's best-known contemporary writers of poetry and prose, and, many would claim, its most influential and imitated poet.

"title : Small Boat: Poems - author : Lesle Lewiscategory : poetrydescription : In Small Boat Lesle Lewis's craft rides the waves of the New England landscape both internal and external. If her world is a collage, as she says, then her poems provide the glue that anchors everything from shifts in the weather to world events to a cacophony of thoughts. When two sentences collide, a new relationship begins, and Lewis's poems bring sense to these complex and disparate juxtapositions. Small Boat, in other words, both creates an exciting chaos and provides a soothing faith.   Read more Read less"
"title : My Sentence Was a Thousand Years of Joy - author : Robert Blycategory : poetrydescription : Readers have found Robert Bly's ghazals startling and new; they merge wildness with a beautiful formality.My Sentence Was a Thousand Years of Joy is Robert Bly's second book of ghazals. The poems have become more intricate and personal than they were in The Night Abraham Called to the Stars, and the leaps even bolder. This book includes the already famous poem against the Iraq War, ""Call and Answer"": ""Tell me why it is we don't lift our voices these days / And cry over what is happening.""The poems are intimate and yet reach out toward the world: the paintings of Robert Motherwell, the intensity of flamenco singers, the sadness of the gnostics, the delight of high spirits and wit. Robert Bly is writing the best poems of his life, and this book reestablishes his position as one of the greatest poets of our era.   Read more Read less"
"title : Out-of-the-body travel - author : Stanley Plumlycategory : poetrydescription : Stanley Plumly won the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award for poetry with his last book, In the Outer Dark. This one, a long sojourn into the poet's Ohio childhood in the 1940s, is equally well-crafted. Most of the poems are written in distilled vernacular, and if they are sometimes slightly prosy, they're accessible and never pedestrian. On the contrary, the poems shake up images fixed in memory, and probe them: the picture of Plumly's mother, for example--standing in the doorway in summer, calling his name--recurs compulsively, evoking sometimes terror, sometimes a suffocating sense that the past can't be relived. The same is true of other memories of his family: the poet records a long-gone moment when his father fell drunk to his knees on the porch, and, in a poem called """"Iron Lung,"""" imagines that he himself is forever trapped in that position. Plumly is sentimentally attached to these atmospheric scenes from childhood, but he is also repelled by the larger-than-life, enshrouding quality their particular images possess: """"My whole body is a lung; I am floating/ above a doorway or a grave."""" The poems are not spectacular; when they stop being descriptive, they often take the tone and diction of an incantation or a prayer. But they are sustained in thrust and skillful, and merit a careful reading.   Read more Read less"

These have now been corrected in one place for the first time by Stevens scholars John N. Serio and Chris Beyers, based on original editions and manuscripts. --   Read more Read less"
"title : There are more beautiful things than Beyoncé - author : Morgan Parkercategory : poetrydescription : ""There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé uses political and pop-cultural references as a framework to explore 21st century black American womanhood and its complexities: performance, depression, isolation, exoticism, racism, femininity, and politics. The poems weave between personal narrative and pop-cultural criticism, examining and confronting modern media, consumption, feminism, and Blackness. This collection explores femininity and race in the contemporary American political climate, folding in references from jazz standards, visual art, personal family history, and Hip Hop. The voice of this book is a multifarious one: writing and rewriting bodies, stories, and histories of the past, as well as uttering and bearing witness to the truth of the present, and actively probing toward a new self, an actualized self. This is a book at the intersections of mythology and sorrow, of vulnerability and posturing, of desire and disgust, of tragedy and excellence""--Publisher.   Read more Read less"
"title : Stuff I've been feeling lately - author : Alicia Cookcategory : poetrydescription : In Alicia Cook's second poetic effort, designed in the style of an old mixtape, she sets her thoughts to a nostalgic tune. There is no Table of Contents. Instead, there is a ""Track List,"" making it easy to refer to them to your friends with a, ""Hey did you read track seven?!"" There are no chapters. Instead, the book is divided into two parts, or as one would say in the 90's, two ""sides."" Side A holds poetry that touches on all aspects of the human condition like life, death, love, moving on, evolving, growing up, hometowns, family dynamic, life after trauma, and make-ups and breakups. Side B holds the ""remixes"" of these poems, in the form of blackout poetry, also known as ""found poetry."" Side B gives the material a fresh twist by creating new poetry out of Side A. There is also a very special surprise at the end of each track. Alicia decided to self publish this effort after leaving her publishing house. She views this book as her ""independence"" and official separation from that venture. She also drew the front and back cover herself. Alicia is a contributing writer for many blogs and news outlets, including the Huffington Post and multiple Gannett Publications. She writes regularly on drug addiction and how it directly affects families.   Read more Read less"

"title : Special Orders: Poems - author : Edward Hirschcategory : poetrydescription : In Special Orders, the renowned poet Edward Hirsch brings us a new series of tightly crafted poems, work that demonstrates a thrilling expansion of his tone and subject matter. It is with a mixture of grief and joy that Hirsch examines what he calls ""the minor triumphs, the major failures"" of his life so far, in lines that reveal a startling frankness in the man composing them, a fearlessness in confronting his own internal divisions: ""I lived between my heart and my head, / like a married couple who can't get along,"" he writes in ""Self-portrait."" These poems constitute a profound, sometimes painful self-examination, by the end of which the poet marvels at the sense of expectancy and transformation he feels. His fifteen-year-old son walking on Broadway is a fledgling about to sail out over the treetops; he has a new love, passionately described in ""I Wish I Could Paint You""; he is ready to live, he tells us, ""solitary, bittersweet, and utterly free.""  More personal than any of his previous collections, Special Orders is Edward Hirsch's most significant book to date.The highway signs pointed to our happiness;the greasy spoons and gleaming truck stopswere the stations of our pilgrimage. Wasn't that us staggering past the riverboats,eating homemade fudge at the county fairand devouring each other's body?They come back to me now, delicious love,the times my sad heart knew a little sweetness.from ""The Sweetness""From the Hardcover edition.

"title : Poems - author : Elizabeth Bishopcategory : poetrydescription : A Boston Globe Best Poetry Book of 2011, this is the definitive edition of the work of one of America's greatest poets, increasingly recognized as one of the greatest English-language poets of the twentieth century, loved by readers and poets alike. Bishop's poems combine humor and sadness, pain and acceptance, and observe nature and lives in perfect miniaturist close-up. The themes central to her poetry are geography and landscape―from New England, where she grew up, to Brazil and Florida, where she later lived―human connection with the natural world, questions of knowledge and perception, and the ability or inability of form to control chaos.

"title : Notes from the Air - author : John Ashberycategory : poetrydescription : His long-awaited volume, a new selection of his later poems, spans ten major collections by one of America's most visionary and influential poets. Chosen by the author himself, the poems in Notes from the Air represent John Ashbery's best work from the past two decades, from the critically acclaimed April Galleons and Flow Chart to the 2005 National Book Award finalist Where Shall I Wander.While Ashbery has long been considered a powerful force in twentieth-century culture, Notes from the Air demonstrates clearly how important and relevant his writing continues to be, well into the twenty-first century. Many of the books from which these poems are drawn are regularly taught in university classrooms across the country, and critics and scholars vigorously debate his newest works as well as his classics. He has already published four major books since the turn of the new millennium, and, although 2007 marks his eightieth birthday, this legendary literary figure continues to write fresh, new, and vibrant poetry that remains as stimulating, provocative, and controversial as ever.Notes from the Air reveals, for the first time in one volume, the remarkable evolution of Ashbery's poetry from the mid-1980s into the new century, and offers an irresistible sampling of some of the finest work by this ""national treasure.""

"title : Anybody - author : Ari Baniascategory : poetrydescription : ""In Anybody, Ari Banias takes up questions of recognition and belonging: how boundaries are drawn and managed, the ways he and she, us and them, here and elsewhere are kept separate, and at what cost identities and selves are forged. Moving through iconic and imagined landscapes, Anybody confronts the strangeness of being alive and of being a restlessly gendered, queer, emotive body. Wherever the poet turns--the cruising spaces of Fire Island, a city lake, a Greek island, a bodega-turned-coffee-shop--he finds the charge of boundedness and signification, the implications of what it means to be a this instead of a that. Witty, tender, and original, these poems pierce the constructs that define our lives"" --   Read more Read less"

"title : The night sky - author : Ann Lauterbachcategory : poetrydescription : A scintillating collection of essays on language from one of literature's most supple mindsIn The Night Sky, her first work of essays, acclaimed poet Ann Lauterbach writes of the ways in which art and poetry are integral and necessary to human conversation. At the center of the book is a series of seven essays, by turns meditative and polemical, that articulate the interstices between Lauterbach's poetics and her experience. She advocates an active encounter with language, at once imaginative and practical, and argues for the importance of art to the well- being of a democratic society. Lauterbach's ""nimble and glittering"" (Booklist) writings bring us to a new understanding of the relationship between self-knowledge and cultural meaning, as well as demonstrating the ways in which contemporary philosophy and theory might be integrated with practical knowledge.

As he watches the ""Resurrection of the little apple tree outside / my window,"" he shakes off his fear of mortality, concluding ""what death . . . There is only / mine / or yours,-- / but the world / will be filled with the living."" In prayerlike poems he invokes the one ""who spoke the world / into being"" and celebrates a dazzling universe--snowflakes descending at nightfall, the intense yellow petals of the September sunflower, the planet adrift in a blizzard of stars, the simple mystery of loving other people. As Wright overcomes a natural tendency toward loneliness and isolation, he gives voice to his hope for ""the only animal that commits suicide,"" and, to our deep pleasure, he arrives at a place of gratitude that is grounded in the earth and its moods.From the Hardcover edition.

"title : Touch - author : Henri Colecategory : poetrydescription : Henri Cole's last three books have shown a continuously mounting talent. In his new book, Touch, written with an almost invisible but ever-present art, he continues to render his human topics―a mother's death, a lover's addiction, war―with a startling clarity. Cole's new poems are impelled by a dark knowledge of the body―both its pleasures and its discontents―and they are written with an aesthetic asceticism in the service of truth.  Alternating between innocence and violent self-condemnation, between the erotic and the elegiac, and between thought and emotion, these poems represent a kind of mid-life selving that chooses life. With his simultaneous impulses to privacy and to connection, Cole neutralizes pain with understatement, masterful cadences, precise descriptions of the external world, and a formal dexterity rarely found in contemporary American poetry.

Notley's work has always been highly narrative, and her new book mixes short lyrics with long, expansive lines of poetry that often take the form of prose sentences, in an effort ""to change writing completely."" The title piece, a folksong-like lament, makes a unified tale out of many stories of many people; the middle section, ""The Black Trailor,"" is a compilation of noir fictions and reflections; while the shorter poems of ""Hemostatic"" range from tough lyrics to sung dramas.

"title : Postcard from P-town - author : Steven Rielcategory : poetrydescription : Poems by Jeff Walt. Number Five in the Keystone Chapbook Series, selected as co-winner of the 2009 Keystone Chapbook Prize by Karen J. Weyant:  ""Jeff Walt's collection is filled with dirt, grit and dust. These tough poems squint in the bright light but focus, fear both real and imaginary dangers but still face the day, fall but get up to brush themselves off and move on. Make no mistake. This is not a collection of love poems, but there's love here, hidden in the cracks of sidewalks, in the fur of an old alley cat, even in the aisles of an adult store . . .""  Jeff Walt was born and raised in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. His poems have appeared in numerous journals, including The Gay & Lesbian Review, Inkwell, New Millenium Writings, Clackamas Literary Review, Bamboo Ridge, Bay Windows, and Connecticut Review; in several anthologies, including Gents, Bad Boys, & Barbarians and The Poets' Grimm. He has one previous chapbook, What I Didn't Know (1998), and his full-length collection, The Danger in Everything, was published in 2001 by Mad River Books.

"title : Why poetry matters - author : Jay Parinicategory : poetrydescription : Poetry doesn’t matter to most people, observes Jay Parini at the opening of this book. But, undeterred, he commences a deeply felt meditation on poetry, its language and meaning, and its power to open minds and transform lives. By the end of the book, Parini has recovered a truth often obscured by our clamorous culture: without poetry, we live only partially, not fully conscious of the possibilities that life affords. Poetry indeed matters.   Read more Read less"

"title : Gedichte Schreiben in Zeiten der Umbrueche - author : Henrieke Stahlcategory : poetrydescription : Gedichte schreiben in Zeiten der Umbrüche - wie reagieren Lyrikerinnen und Lyriker auf die Transformationsprozesse seit 1990? Das interkulturelle und interdisziplinäre Forschungsprojekt soll neue Perspektiven auf die russische wie die deutsche Gegenwartsliteratur eröffnen, fokussiert auf eine literarische Gattung, die traditionell am ehesten und am sensibelsten seismographische Funktionen des Wandels anzeigt: die Lyrik. Der Band fragt nicht nur nach der Bedeutung der politischen Konstellationen des Umbruchs von Sowjetunion zur russischen Föderation und der Wende in Deutschland für die Lyrik, sondern bezieht weitere Diskurse mit ein, die im transnationalen Kontext die Gegenwart seit 1990 bestimmen: Gibt es in Russland und Deutschland parallele Entwicklungen? Welche Differenzen prägen die Gegenwartslyrik beider Länder? Welche Auswirkung haben die seit 2000 verstärkt einsetzende Globalisierung und Digitalisierung sowie die ökonomisch und politisch bedingten Krisen auf die Lyrik? Haben die politischen sowie medialen und technologischen Umbrüche Bedeutung für die Themenwahl, die kommunikativen und ästhetischen Funktionen, die poetischen Verfahren und Strategien? Können für die letzten 25 Jahre poetische und auch poetologisch reflektierte Veränderungen ausgemacht werden? Die Beiträge des Bandes zeigen, dass die neuere russisch- und deutschsprachige Lyrik eine hochgradige Heterogenität und Ungleichzeitigkeit im Hinblick auf Poetik, Stile und Milieus prägen. Hybridität, Experimente mit Grenzen der Gattungen, Sprachen, Medien oder auch zwischen Soziolekten, Kulturen und sozialen Milieus gehen zusammen mit einem hohen Bewusstsein für die Sprachlichkeit, Diskurszugehörigkeit und Performativität von Lyrik. Politisches Bewusstsein in der Lyrik und Radikalität in Tabubruch und Experimenten mit Genre und Sprache, paradox gepaart mit einem hohen poetischen Traditionsbewusstsein, charakterisieren besonders die russische Lyrik der Gegenwart.

"title : Time and Materials - author : Robert Hasscategory : poetrydescription : The poems in Robert Hass's new collection—his first to appear in a decade—are grounded in the beauty and energy of the physical world, and in the bafflement of the present moment in American culture. This work is breathtakingly immediate, stylistically varied, redemptive, and wise.His familiar landscapes are here—San Francisco, the Northern California coast, the Sierra high country—in addition to some of his oft-explored themes: art; the natural world; the nature of desire; the violence of history; the power and limits of language; and, as in his other books, domestic life and the conversation between men and women. New themes emerge as well, perhaps: the essence of memory and of time.The works here look at paintings, at Gerhard Richter as well as Vermeer, and pay tribute to his particular literary masters, friend Czeslaw Milosz, the great Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer, Horace, Whitman, Stevens, Nietszche, and Lucretius. We are offered glimpses of a surpris­ingly green and vibrant twenty-first-century Berlin; of the demilitarized zone between the Koreas; of a Bangkok night, a Mexican desert, and an early summer morning in Paris, all brought into a vivid present and with a passionate meditation on what it is and has been to be alive. ""It has always been Mr. Hass's aim,"" the New York Times Book Review wrote, ""to get the whole man, head and heart and hands and every­thing else, into his poetry.""Every new volume by Robert Hass is a major event in poetry, and this beautiful collection is no exception.

Blue dances on summer lakes, green drips from spring leaves, black wafts mysteriously through autumn evenings.

"title : Jubilee - author : Roxane Beth Johnsoncategory : poetrydescription : Jubilee by Roxane Beth Johnson won the 2005 Philip Levine Prize for Poetry. ""These luminous poems depict a world I never knew—or know as a child and since forgot—and they do so with the authority of a totally mature voice. The artistry that unifies Jubilee is so perfect it is almost invisible. Altogether an amazing debut . . .""    —Philip Levine.  ""In Jubilee, the effects of gravity are reversed in order to capture how the world weighs on the mind . . . These often deceptively measured prose poems critique not only their own form, but the structures, the foundations, of family, spirituality, and identity which we often fail to examine. Each self-portrait tells us as much about the environment as it reveals about the subject occupying them--the poet creating with a small mirror in one hand, a pen/camera/brush/etching knife in the other. . .""    —Kyle G.

"title : Unreconciled - author : Michel Houellebecqcategory : poetrydescription : Selected poems from the critically acclaimed author of Submission and The Elementary Particles. A selection of poems chosen from four collections of one of France's authors, Unreconciled shines a fresh light on Michel Houellebecq and reveals the radical singularity of his work. Drawing on themes that are similar to the ones in his novels, these poems are a journey into the depths of individual experience and universal passions. Divided into five parts, Unreconciled forms a narrative of love, hopelessness, catastrophe, dedication, and--ultimately--redemption. In a world of supermarkets and public transportation, indifferent landscapes and lonely nights, Houellebecq manages to find traces of divine grace even as he exposes our inexorable decline into chaos. Told through forms and rhythms that are both ancient and new, with language steeped in the everyday, Unreconciled stands in the tradition of Baudelaire while making a bold new claim on contemporary verse. It reveals that in addition to his work as an incisive novelist, Houellebecq is one of our most perceptive poets with a vision of our era that brims with tensions that cannot--and will not--be reconciled.

"title : Sea Change: Poems - author : Jorie Grahamcategory : poetrydescription : The New York Times has said that ""Jorie Graham's poetry is among the most sensuously embodied and imaginative writing we have,"" and this new collection is a reminder of how startling, original, and deeply relevant her poetry is. In Sea Change, Graham brings us to the once-unimaginable threshold at which civilization as we know it becomes unsustainable. How might the human spirit persist, caught between its abiding love of beauty, its acknowledgment of continuing injury and damage done, and the realization that the existence of a ""future"" itself may no longer be assured?There is no better writer to confront such crucial matters than Jorie Graham. In addition to her recognized achievements as a poet of philosophical, aesthetic, and moral concerns, Graham has also been acknowledged as ""our most formidable nature poet"" (Publishers Weekly). As gorgeous and formally inventive as anything she has written, Sea Change is an essential work speaking out for our planet and the world we have known.   Read more Read less"

Coggeshall (1824-1867) was a journalist and publisher, and editor of The Genius of the West, a literary magazine in Cincinnati. He served as State Librarian of Ohio from 1856 to 1862.  The editor wrote in his Preface that it was his intention to include in the collection every person “…legitimately belonging to the West, who has gained recognition as a writer of reputable verse.” It contains selections, with biographical notices, from the writings of 97 men and 55 women. 60 were residents of Ohio, 23 of Indiana, 14 of Kentucky, 13 of Illinois, 5 of Michigan and 4 of Wisconsin. Not more than 10 of these poets pursued literature as a profession. The volume contains poems from about 1815 to the early 1860s.

"title : Three homeric hymns - author : N. J. Richardsoncategory : poetrydescription : ""These lively narrative poems, attributed in antiquity to Homer, are works of great charm. Composed for recitation at festivals in honour of the gods, they tell of Apollo's birth on the island of Delos and his foundation of the Delphic oracle; Hermes' invention of the lyre and theft of his brother Apollo's cattle; and Aphrodite's love affair with the mortal Anchises. This edition offers a new text of these poems. The Introduction discusses among other things the nature and purpose of the poems in general, their origins, their structure and themes. The Commentary brings out the individual character of each Hymn, by analyzing in depth its language and literary qualities, and also its religious and historical aspects. The aim is to make these Hymns more accessible to students of Greek literature, and help them to appreciate the poems more fully as major works of early Greek poetry""--Provided by publisher.  ""Most of these poems probably belong to the 'Archaic' period, but some appear to be later in date. An Attic vase painting shows a boy holding a papyrus-roll, on which are written what appear to be the opening two words of Hymn. It has been inferred that some at least of the hymns could have already been used as school texts at this time. Our earliest explicit reference to one of the hymns is by Thucydides, who quotes two passages from the Hymn to Apollo,ascribes it to Homer. Later writers, however,from the second century onwards, express doubts about Homer's authorship of the Hymns. Athenaeus attributes the Hymn to Apollo to 'Homer or one of the Homeridae', and a scholiast to Pindar, Nemean ascribes it to a rhapsode named Cynaethus . Hymn is quoted by a scholiast to Nicander as 'among the hymns ascribed to Homer', and some of the Lives of Homer assert that only the Iliad and Odyssey are definitely Homer's own work. Alexandrian scholarship does not often refer to the Hymns, and this suggests that by the Hellenistic period, if not before, their authenticity as Homeric was questioned""--Provided by publisher.

"title : Bicycles: Love Poems - author : Nikki Giovannicategory : poetrydescription : In a career that has earned her accolades, honorary degrees, and awards from both fellow poets and everyday poetry lovers, Nikki Giovanni has established herself as a writer who can entertain and challenge, inform and inspire. Sometimes controversial, sometimes ethereal, but always beautiful, her poems move readers of all hues and generations. With Bicycles, she's collected poems that serve as a companion to her 1997 Love Poems. An instant classic, that book — romantic, bold, and erotic — expressed notions of love in ways that were delightfully unexpected. In the years that followed, Giovanni experienced losses both public and private. A mother's passing, a sister's, too. A massacre on the campus at which she teaches. And just when it seemed life was spinning out of control, Giovanni redis-covered love — what she calls the antidote. Here romantic love — and all its manifestations, the physical touch, the emotional pull, the hungry heart — is distilled as never before by one of our most talented poets.   Read more Read less"

"title : Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea - author : Nikki Giovannicategory : poetrydescription : When Nikki Giovanni's poems first emerged during the Civil Rights and Black Arts Movements of the 1960s, she immediately took a place among the most celebrated and influential poets of the era. Now, Giovanni continues to stand as one of the most commanding, luminous voices to grace America's political and poetic landscape.In a career spanning over thirty years, Giovanni has created a body of work that's become vital and essential to our American consciousness. This collection of new poems is a masterpiece that explores the ecstatic union between self and community. Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea is an extraordinarily intimate collection. Each poem bears our revered cultural icon's trademark of the unfalteringly political and the intensely personal: The elegant ""What We Miss"" exalts the might and grace of women, while ""Swinging on a Rainbow"" rejoices about the spaces in which we read; Giovanni commemorates Africa and her family legacy in the majestic ""Symphony of the Sphinx"" and contemplates our America in the heartbreaking ""Desperate Acts"" and ""9:11:01 He Blew It."" And in the dreamy ""Making James Baldwin"" and dazzling ""Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea,"" Giovanni gives us reason to comfort, to share, to love, to change and to be human. Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea is Nikki Giovanni's meditation on humanity and soul. It's her revelatory gaze at the world in which we live -- and her confession on the world she dreams we will one day call home. Nikki Giovanni is a national treasure as she once again confirms her place as one of America's most powerful truth tellers and beloved daughters.   Read more Read less"
"title : Motherland, fatherland, homelandsexuals - author : Patricia Lockwoodcategory : poetrydescription : ""A breathtaking new collection from one of today's boldest and most adventurous poets; Colloquial and incantatory, the poems in Patricia Lockwood's second collection address the most urgent questions of our time, like: what if a deer did porn? Is America going down on Canada? What happens when Niagara Falls gets drunk at a wedding? Is it legal to marry a stuffed owl exhibit? What would Walt Whitman's tit-pics look like? Why isn't anyone named Gary anymore? Did the Hatfield and McCoy babies ever fall in love? The steep tilt of Lockwood's lines sends the reader snowballing downhill, accumulating pieces of the scenery with every turn. The poems' subject is the natural world, but their images would never occur in nature. This book is serious and funny at the same time, like a big grave with a clown lying in it.

"title : R.S. Thomas - author : Christopher Morgancategory : poetrydescription : Christopher Morgan writes with keen critical insight on the controversial poet R. S. Thomas, considered to be one of the leading writers of the twentieth century. This is the first book to treat Thomas's entire oeuvre and will prove to be an indispensible guide and companion to the complete poems. Morgan not only recontextualises and reinterprets the poet's major themes of self, nature, and the search for deity; he breaks new ground with a penetrating investigation of Thomas's long preoccupation with the philosophical and practical implications of science and technology. The book is divided into three parts, each of which interprets the development of a major theme over Thomas's twenty-seven volumes, probing these particular themes and particular poems, with a meticulous insight. The book also treats Thomas's work as a complex and interrelated whole, as a body of work that comprises a single artistic achievement, and assesses that achievement within the context of an array of major literary figures from Montaigne to Seamus Heaney and Wallace Stevens. 'R. S. Thomas: Identity, environment, deity' proves invaluable as a beginner's introduction to the Welsh poet, as a student's guide to critical thinking about the poet's work, and as a provocative new step in scholarly studies.

"title : Snowline - author : Donato Mancinicategory : poetrydescription : ?Mais où sont les neiges d?antan?? François Villon?s most famous line is a kind of translation, a variation of the old ?ubi sunt? trope: Where are the things that used to be? But Villon specifically asks: Where are the snows? Even in the thick of a snowy winter, this snow is not the same as the remembered snows. The difference is affective, but it is also ecological: the world?s climate is dramatically changing. Winter itself is changing.  Donato Mancini has collected over eighty translations of Villon?s line, from Thomas Urquhart?s 1653 translation of Rabelais?s quotation of the line, all the way up to translations by Florence Dujarric (2013) and Michael Barnholden (2014). From these he has arranged forty ? a number that once stood for a countless number, like the forty thieves or the forty years of the biblical flood ? into a booklength poem.  Taking a cue from Caroline Bergvall?s ?Via,? but deviating from it in significant ways, snowline traces how Villon?s line has changed and yet stubbornly stayed the same over six hundred years. It is a meditative and pointedly nostalgiac book: You will grow older as you read it, and the world around you will continue to melt into air.   Read more Read less"

"title : Vertical Readings in Dante's Comedy - author : Heather Webbcategory : poetrydescription : ""Vertical Readings in Dante’s Comedy is a reappraisal of the poem by an international team of thirty-four scholars. Each vertical reading analyses three same-numbered cantos from the three canticles: Inferno i, Purgatorio i and Paradiso i; Inferno ii, Purgatorio ii and Paradiso ii; etc. Although scholars have suggested before that there are correspondences between same-numbered cantos that beg to be explored, this is the first time that the approach has been pursued in a systematic fashion across the poem. This collection in three volumes offers an unprecedented repertoire of vertical readings for the whole poem. As the first volume exemplifies, vertical reading not only articulates unexamined connections between the three canticles but also unlocks engaging new ways to enter into core concerns of the poem. The three volumes thereby provide an indispensable resource for scholars, students and enthusiasts of Dante.    The volume has its origin in a series of thirty-three public lectures held in Trinity College, the University of Cambridge (2012-2016) which can be accessed at the Cambridge Vertical Readings in Dante’s Comedy website.""

"title : Yeats's Legacies - author : Warwick Gouldcategory : poetrydescription : ""The two great Yeats Family Sales of 2017 and the legacy of the Yeats family’s 80-year tradition of generosity to Ireland’s great cultural institutions provide the kaleidoscope through which these advanced research essays find their theme. Hannah Sullivan’s brilliant history of Yeats’s versecraft challenges Poundian definitions of Modernism; Denis Donoghue offers unique family memories of 1916 whilst tracing the political significance of the Easter Rising; Anita Feldman addresses Yeats’s responses to the Rising’s appropriation of his symbols and myths, the daring artistry of his ritual drama developed from Noh, his poetry of personal utterance, and his vision of art as a body reborn rather than a treasure preserved amid the testing of the illusions that hold civilizations together in ensuing wars. Warwick Gould looks at Yeats as founding Senator in the new Free State, and his valiant struggle against the literary censorship law of 1929 (with its present-day legacy of Irish anti-blasphemy law still presenting a constitutional challenge). Drawing on Gregory Estate documents, James Pethica looks at the evictions which preceded Yeats’s purchase of Thoor Ballylee in Galway; Lauren Arrington looks back at Yeats, Ezra Pound, and the Ghosts of The Winding Stair (1929) in Rapallo. Having co-edited both versions of A Vision, Catherine Paul offers some profound reflections on ‘Yeats and Belief’. Grevel Lindop provides a pioneering view of Yeats’s impact on English mystical verse and on Charles Williams who, while at Oxford University Press, helped publish the Oxford Book of Modern Verse. Stanley van der Ziel looks at the presence of Shakespeare in Yeats’s Purgatory. William H. O’Donnell examines the vexed textual legacy of his late work, On the Boiler while Gould considers the challenge Yeats’s intentionalism posed for once-fashionable post-structuralist editorial theory. John Kelly recovers a startling autobiographical short story by Maud Gonne. While nine works of current biographical, textual and literary scholarship are reviewed, Maud Gonne is the focus of debate for two reviewers, as are Eva Gore-Booth, Constance and Casimir Markievicz, Rudyard Kipling, David Jones, T. S. Eliot and his presence on the radio. ""   Read more Read less"

"title : Reconsidering Longfellow - author : Christoph Irmschercategory : poetrydescription : Reconsidering Longfellow is the first collection of scholarly essays in several decades devoted entirely to the work and afterlife of the most popular and widely read writer in American literature. The essays, written by a new generation of Longfellow scholars, cover the entire range of Longfellow’s work, from the early poetry to the wildly successful epics of his middle period (Evangeline, The Song of Hiawatha) to his Chaucerian collection of stories published after the Civil War, Tales of a Wayside Inn. Separate contributions discuss Longfellow’s financial dealings, his preoccupation with his children, and his interest in the visual arts, as well as the tremendous role his poetry did and will once again play in American literature classrooms in the U.S. All essays were written specifically for the volume.

Purdy's exquisitely surreal fiction has been populated for more than 40 years by social outcasts living in crisis and longing for love. However, Purdy was also among the first novelists to incorporate transgressive renderings of gay life into his work, including unapologetic, sexually explicit material. Narrow Rooms—his 1978 classic that ranks among his most masterful novels—is a passionate and sometimes bloody love story about adolescent obsession and revenge.   Read more Read less"

"title : We Speak Your Names: A Celebration - author : Pearl Cleagecategory : poetrydescription : For centuries, African American women have been remaking the world, giving testament to the power of hope, courage, and resilience. But it took the inspired generosity of Oprah Winfrey to honor fully the many gifts of sisterhood. For three amazing days--from May 13 to 15, 2005--a distinguished group of women was invited to celebrate the enduring achievements of twenty-five of their mentors and role models--and in the process pay tribute to the long, glorious tradition of African American accomplishment.The brilliant centerpiece of the weekend was the reading aloud of Pearl Cleage's poem ""We Speak Your Names,"" written especially for the occasion and appearing here for the first time in this beautiful keepsake book. As deeply moving in print as it was during that weekend of love and praise, the poem names each of the women honored: Dr. Maya Angelou, Coretta Scott King, Diahann Carroll, Toni Morrison, Nikki Giovanni, Rosa Parks, Katherine Dunham, and other legends of the brightest magnitude. With heartfelt eloquence, Pearl Cleage (herself a luminary of the younger generation) celebrates her distinguished elders' strength, their magic, their sensuality, their loving kindness, their faith in themselves, and the priceless example of their lives. In her introduction, the poet shares: ""My sisters, here, there, and everywhere, this poem is for you. Use it, adapt it, pass it on. . . ."" Destined to become a classic, We Speak Your Names is a treasure to keep forever and a precious, inspiring gift for the ones you love.From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less"
"title : The ballad of Reading Gaol and other poems - author : Oscar Wildecategory : poetrydescription : This poem - originally published anonymously, written after Wilde's two year's hard labour in Reading prison - is the tale of a man who has been sentenced to hang for the murder of the woman he loved. The Ballad of Reading Gaol follows the inmate through his final three weeks, as he stares at the sky and silently drinks his beer ration. Heart-wrenching and eye-opening, the ballad also expresses perfectly Wilde's belief that humanity is made up only of offenders, each of us deserving a greater charity for the severity of our crimes.

"title : Leaving Yuba City - author : Chitra Banerjee Divakarunicategory : poetrydescription : Like Divakaruni's much-loved and bestselling short story collection Arranged Marriage, this collection of poetry deals with India and the Indian experience in America, from the adventures of going to a convent school in India run by Irish nuns (Growing up in Darjeeling) to the history of the earliest Indian immigrants in the U.S. (Yuba City Poems).Groups of interlinked poems divided into six sections are peopled by many of the same characters and explore varying themes. Here, Divakaruni is particularly interested in how different art forms can influence and inspire each other. One section, entitled Indian Miniatures, is based on and named after a series of paintings by Francesco Clemente. Another, called Moving Pictures, is based on Indian films, including Mira Nair's ""Salaam Bombay"" and Satyajit Ray's ""Ghare Baire."" Photographs by Raghubir Singh inspired the section entitled Rajasthani. The trials and tribulations of growing up and immigration are also considered here and, as with all of Divakaruni's writing, these poems deal with the experience of women and their struggle to find identities for themselves.This collection is touched with the same magic and universal appeal that excited readers of Arranged Marriage. In Leaving Yuba City, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni proves once again her remarkable literary talents.   Read more Read less"
"title : Full volume - author : Crawford, Robertcategory : poetrydescription : Listening, love, and a quickened awareness of vulnerability enrich the Scottish poet Robert Crawford's sixth collection of poems...Holding in balance the ecological and the technological, ancient and modern, Full Volume sings languages and cultures, people and habitats burgeoning on the brink of extinction. From revved-up battle-cry to nervous whisper, these lyrical poems praise intricate abundance. Assured in its rhymes and cadences, Full Volume is often attentive to poetry in other tongues, not least Gaelic. As their tones and forms shift from the spiritual to the wry, from haiku to brosnachadh, the poems' resonance and music build into a sustained sounding of what it means to live, love, and listen in a world where 'Nothing is ever single'.

"title : The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni, 1968–1998 - author : Nikki Giovannicategory : poetrydescription : For the first time ever, the complete poetry collection spanning three decades from Nikki Giovanni, renowned poet and one of America's national treasures.When her poems first emerged during the Black Arts Movement in the 1960s, Nikki Giovanni immediately took her place among the most celebrated, controversial, and influential poets of the era. Now, more than thirty years later, Giovanni still stands as one of the most commanding, luminous voices to grace America's political and poetic landscape.The first of its kind, this omnibus collection covers Nikki Giovanni's complete work of poetry from three decades, 1968–1998. The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni contains Giovanni's first seven volumes of poetry: Black Feeling Black Talk, Black Judgement, Re: Creation, My House, The Women and the Men, Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day, and Those Who Ride the Night Winds. Arranged chronologically with a biographical timeline and introduction, a new afterword from the author, title and first-line indexes, and extensive notes to the poems, this collection is the testimony of a life's work -- from one of America's most beloved daughters and powerful poets.Known for their iconic revolutionary phrases, Black Feeling Black Talk (1968), Black Judgement (1968), and Re: Creation (1970) are heralded as being among the most important volumes of contemporary poetry. My House (1972) marks a new dimension in tone and philosophy -- it signifies a new self-confidence and maturity as Giovanni artfully connects the private and the public, the personal and the political. In The Women and the Men (1975), Giovanni displays her compassion for the people, things, and places she has encountered -- she reveres the ordinary and is in search of the extraordinary. Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day (1978) is one of the most poignant and introspective. These poems chronicle the drastic change that took place during the 1970s -- in both the consciousness of the nation and in the soul of the poet -- when the dreams of the Civil Rights era seemed to have evaporated. Those Who Ride the Night Winds (1983) is devoted to ""the day trippers and midnight cowboys,"" the ones who have devoted their lives to pushing the limits of the human condition and shattering the constraints of the status quo.Each volume reflects the changes Giovanni has endured as a Black woman, lover, mother, teacher, and poet. A timeless classic, The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni is the evocation of a nation's past and present -- intensely personal and fiercely political -- from one of our most compassionate, vibrant observers.

"title : Disobedience - author : Alice Notleycategory : poetrydescription : Alice Notley has earned a reputation as one of the most challenging and engaging radical female poets at work today. Her last collection, Mysteries of Small Houses, was a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize in poetry and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Structured as a long series of interconnected poems in which one of the main elements is an ongoing dialogue with a seedy detective, Disobedience sets out to explore the visible as well as the unconscious. These poems, composed during a fifteen-month period, also deal with being a woman in France, with turning fifty, and with being a poet, and thus seemingly despised or at least ignored.

He is widely regarded as the father of Persian poetry, for he was the first major poet to write in New Persian language, following the Arab conquest in the seventh and eighth centuries, which established Islam as the official religion, and made Arabic the predominant literary language in Persian-speaking lands for some two centuries. This book presents Rudaki as the founder of a new poetic aesthetic, which was adopted by subsequent generations of Persian poets. Rudaki is credited with being the first to write in the rubâi form; and many of the images we first encounter in Rudaki?s lines have become staples of Persian poetry.   Read more Read less"

title : الشعر والدين: فاعلية الرمز الديني المقدس في الشعر العربي - author : Kāmil Ṣāliḥcategory : poetrydescription : كتاب الشعر والدين : فاعلية الرمز الديني في الشعر العربي،    هو للكاتب والأكاديمي اللبناني كامل فرحان صالح - kamel farhan saleh    صدر في طبعته الأولى عن دار الحداثة في بيروت، ولدى المجلس الأعلى للثقافة، القاهرة في العام 2010، في طبعة ثانية.    الكتاب يقع في 416 صفحة من القطع الكبير، ويضم ثلاثة أبواب، وكل باب ينقسم إلى فصول عدة:    الباب الأول ويضم فصلين: قرأ الكتاب فيه فاعلية النص الديني في الشعر العربي في أبرز محطاتها. واستهل بمدخل بحث في العلاقة بين الدين والشعر.    الفصل الأول تناول الدين والشعر في المجتمع العربي القديم، من خلال النصوص المتأثرة بالوثنية والحنيفية، الفصل الثاني خصص للرموز الدينية في الشعر العربي ما قبل الحديث،    أما الباب الثاني فبحث في إرهاصات الهوية العربية في بدايات القرن العشرين، كذلك تناول المؤثرات الغربية في الشعر العربي، واشتمل على فصلين:الفصل الأول، بحث في صراعات الذات الثقافية العربية، وخصص جانبًا لقراءة النظرة السلفية للتجديد في الشعر العربي.    الفصل الثاني بحث في المؤثرات الأجنبية في الشعر العربي الحديث، ولاسيما من خلال تأثير الأرض الخراب The Waste Land لـ ت. س. إليوت. وركّز في هذا الإطار على تأثير إليوت في    شعر بدر شاكر السياب ويوسف الخال وخليل حاوي. كذلك حاول الكتاب تقديم قراءة في دور مجلة شعر، لاسيما صراع الهوية وتفعيل حضور الآخر فيها.أما الباب الثالث والأخير فخصص لبحث فاعلية الرمز الديني في الشعر العربي الحديث، وضمّ فصلين: الفصل الأول قرأ سعيَ الشعراء العرب المعاصرين لإيجاد صيغة جديدة للشعر، وعلاقة هؤلاء الشعراء بالتراث والمجتمع، والنظرة للغة العربية. ولم ينس أن يبحث في محاولاتهم لاختراق النظام الشعري المتوارث.    الفصل الثاني تناول حضور التأثير الديني في الشعر العربي الحديث، ولاسيما من خلال فاعلية الحضور والتحول. واشتمل كذلك على تأثير الأسطورة في الشعر، والعلاقة الإشكالية وحضور هذا التشابك في الشعر.كما بحث هذا الفصل في جوانب أكثر تحديدًا في مفاصل فاعلية التأثير الديني في الشعر، فتناول البحث في أبعاد دينية متنوعة ومختلفة في الشعر، ولاسيما حضور الخبز أو العشاء الأخير، كذلك حاول أن يتناول عددًا من الأماكن والاشارات الدينية في الشعر العربي المعاصر.    أما المنهج الذي اتبعه الكتاب، فيوضح المؤلف في المقدمة ان منهج دراسته اتصف بقدر كبير من المرونة التي يمكن أن تتسع، وتلم بحدوده المتشعبة، لذا، المنهج الذي اعتمده زاوج فيه بين منهجين، وهما:    أ- المنهج التاريخي، لملاحقة تطورِ مسارِ العلاقةِ بين الشعرِ والدين، وعلاقات التأثير والتأثر .    ب- المنهج التحليلي، لرصد مدى تأثير النصِّ في إنجازات النص الشعري، ومستوياتِ هذا التأثيرِ على الشكل والمضمون الشعري، ثم القراءة التحليلية المقارنة الموضوعية للامساك بما تناثر من اللاوعي الشعري من الرموز الدينية في متنِ المنجزِ الشعري وحوافيه.    يستهل الكاتب كتابه بالقول انه عندما أراد الشعراء العرب المعاصرون التعبيرَ عن أزمة ما تعصف بمجتمعاتِهم أو بكيانِهم، اختارَ قسم منهم، أن يتكئَ على بعدٍ دينيٍّ في شعره، ليطلَ من خلاله على ما يريد قوله، موظفًا لذلك لفظةً تحسب على هذا النص الديني أو رمزًا ينسب إليه أو حالةً تجد مساحتَها الخصبة فيه ومنه.    واضاف قائلا: إن ركون الشعراء العرب المعاصرين للنص الديني ، حضر بعمقٍ، ليعبّر عن قلقٍ وجوديٍّ إنسانيٍّ مجتمعيّ يعيشه الشاعر بكيانِه كلِّه؛ فالشاعر خليل حاوي على سبيل المثال كتب قصيدتَه 1962، عندما أراد إعلان رفضهِ، والتعبير عن حال الإحباط، التي يشعر بها هو والمجتمع العربي كلُّه، بسببِ الانفصال بين مصر وسوريا، كذلك لجأَ الشاعر بدر شاكر السياب ، ليكتبَ قصيدتَه: عندما أرادَ التعبير عن قلقِه مما يتخبط به الواقع العربي عامةً والعراقي خاصةً، ولم يبتعد الشعراءُ أمثال أدونيس ويوسف الخال وأنسي الحاج وأمل دنقل وعبد الوهاب البياتي ومحمد الماغوط عن ذلك المسار، حيث أخذ كلُّ واحدٍ منهم من التربة الدينية ما يتناسبُ وزرعَهُ، أي قصيدتَه، موظفًا رمزًا دينيًّا يشق من خلاله حجب مشاعره ورؤاه وهواجسه ويأسه ومأزقه الوجودي.هذا الأخذ من النصِّ الديني ، لم يكن وليدَ هؤلاء الشعراء آنذاك،- حسبما يوضح الكاتب - إنما تتناثر جذوره عميقًا في التاريخِ العربي والعالمي على السواء، إذ كان الشعر يتلبس الدين للخروج إلى مساحاتٍ أوسعَ من الواقع المباشر إلى مسافةٍ تمتد بين الأرضِ والسماء، كما أن الدينََ كان يجد حضوره الخصب ، في التعبير الشعري.أمام هذه العلاقة التشابكية بين الشعر والدين، شرع الكاتب العمل في هذا البحث، محاولاً رصد هذا الحضور الإبداعي، وتلمسَهُ، عبر نماذجَ من الشعرِ العربي عامةً والحديثِ خاصةً، واقفًا على آفاقه الرحبة والغنية والملتبسة.وقد جمع مادته البحثية على مراحل - كما يقول- بدأت من دواوين الشعراء القدامى والمعاصرين، حيث جرى ما يُشبه الرصدَ للنصوص الخاضعة لشروط البحث، ترافق ذلك بقراءة للنصوص الدينية ، ثم مقاربة الدراسات التاريخية والإنسانية والانثربولجية والنقدية التي كانت تتعارض أو تلامس بشكل أو بآخرَ مسار بحثه.أما بالنسبة إلى تحديدِ الشعراء، فركّز الكتاب على بعض الشعراء الذين طبعُوا زمنَهم بإسهامات شعرية مميزة، كان لها الأثر البارز والواضح في حركة الشعر العربي الحديث، أمثال: بدر شاكر السياب، خليل حاوي، أدونيس، يوسف الخال، أنسي الحاج، أمل دنقل، محمد الماغوط.    وكانت دراسته لنماذجَ من شعرهم الذي خضع لشروط الموضوعات المبنية على المؤثرات الدينية.    كامل صالح يخلص في كتابه للقول ان العلاقة بين الدين والشعر واضحة في المجتمعات العربية القديمة -قبل الإسلام- من خلال العديد من النماذج الشعرية التي قاربت القضايا الدينية، وكانت - بهذه الدرجة أو تلك - تعبر عن القناعات والآراء والتعاليم والحكم الدينية، وذهب بعض الدارسين إلى القول إن الشعر العربي نشأ في حضن الدين، وإن هذه البدايات تبدو واضحة في أنماط الأهازيج الشعرية ذات الطابع الديني، ولاسيما تلك التي تستخدم في بعض الممارسات الدينية.وقد بدا واضحًا تأثر النص الشعري بالنصوص الدينية - قبل الإسلام - في العديد من النصوص الشعرية التي تؤكد تأثر واضعيها حيث ظهرت بوضوح في بعض النماذج الشعرية العربية قبل الإسلام.    ويلحظ الكاتب ان الشاعر العربي - قبل الإسلام - كان حرًا في علاقته بالنصوص المقدسة، إلا أنه ظل يحتفظ بمسافة بين: الشعري والنص ، حيث لم يكن يعارضه، أو يحاول محاذاته، إلا أنه أعطى نفسه هامش التعبير عن القيم الدينية بلغته، وبطريقته الخاصة، لكن لم يقارب هذه النصوص المقدسة بأي شكل من الأشكال، بل ظل صدى لها، يعبر عن قيمها وتعاليمها.بالمقابل يرى الكاتب ان الشعر تراجع مع الإسلام، الذي أبدى شيئًا من التحفظ على الممارسة الشعرية، ووضع لها شروطًا، وحدد لها حدودًا، فسادت وسيطرت سلطة النص القرآني بصورة مطلقة على كل قول، حيث إنه اختزل صور القول الحق كلها، واكتفى الشعر بهامش ترديد صدى التعاليم الإسلامية، أو لاذ بهامش الهرطقة والمجون ليعبر عن نفسه.    وخلال القرون ما بعد العصر العباسي وإلى بدايات الخلافة العثمانية، لاحظ الكاتب إن حركة الشعر تجمّدت شكلاً في البحور الخليلية، ومضمونًا في الأغراض التعليمية والاخوانيات والغزل المبتذل، والتقريظ والمدح والهجاء المكرر الخالي من الإبداع والتجديد، إلى أن تعرض العالم العربي لصدمة اتصاله بالغرب، فاتضح له مدى تخلفه وضعفه ، فكان أن نشأت - نتيجة لهذا الغزو - بعض التيارات التي تراوحت ردود فعلها في ثلاثة اتجاهات: اتجاه ينادي بضرورة اتباع الغرب في كل شيء، والأخذ منه بلا قيد ولا شرط. واتجاه ينادي برفض كل ما هو غربي ومقاطعته، ورفض الغرب ذاته، متمسكًا ومتخندقًا في هويته الذاتية السلفية. أما الاتجاه الثالث فحاول التوفيق بين الاتجاهين، فسعى يبحث عن جذور ما أنتجه الغرب في ثقافته العربية/ الإسلامية.    بناء على ذلك، صنف الكاتب هذه الاتجاهات في ثلاثة تيارات: حداثية، وسلفية، وتوفيقية، مؤكدا ان صدمة الاتصال بالغرب (الغازي) أحدثت شروخًا في الذات العربية، هي التي حددت اتجاهاته الفكرية/ الانفعالية في الحدود والتيارات التي حددت سابقًا.واضاف قائلا بدا تأثير هذا الاتصال/ الصدمة واضحًا في حركات التجديد الشعري منذ أوائل القرن الماضي، سواء في المهجر أو في مصر - مدرسة الديوان-، إلا أن إرهاصات هذا التأثير بدت واضحة في المدارس الشعرية التي تأثرت بالمدرسة الرومانطيقية - أبولو -، وفي بعض محاولات الخروج الشعرية الفردية.    إزاء هذه المحاولات التجديدية المتأثرة بالثقافة الغربية، يتناول الكاتب نشاط حركة النقد السلفي، التي حاولت التصدي لهذا التيار التغريبي، حسب رأيها. إلا أن ردة فعلها العاطفية في مواجهة محاولات التجديد دفعتها إلى حد المقاومة القصوى، حين تعاملت مع هذه الحركة باعتبارها مؤامرة ثقافية تستهدف وجود الأمة، ودينها وتاريخها، من هنا راحت تحاكم هذه الحركة التجديدية بهذا المعيار السياسي والأخلاقي، والمعيار الديني بشكل أساس.ويضيف قائلا ان النقد السلفي تأسس على رؤية تمازج ما بين الديني والتقليدي، لذا، اقتصرت مرجعياته النقدية على خطين متقاطعين بالضرورة: من حيث الشكل، التقنية الخليلية هي المرجع لـ form القصيدة، والقصيدة الجاهلية هي المعيار الفني المتكامل، حسب رأي هذا الاتجاه، أما من حيث المضمون فالإسلام وتعاليمه هو المصدر والمرجع لمضمون القصيدة.    إلا أن المسيرة التجديدية في الثقافة العربية عامة، والشعر خاصة، أخذت تشق طريقها، كما يقول الكاتب، تحت تأثير الاتصال المباشر بالثقافة الغربية، ليلاحظ الباحث أن تيار التجديد تجاوز - في الهزيع الأخير من أربعينيات القرن الماضي - الأطر التقنية الشكلية للقصيدة العربية، ليلامس - بالتجاوز - أطرًا أعمق وأكثر جذرية: اجتماعية وثقافية ودينية وفكرية، ويمكن القول إن التيار الحداثي أخذ يرسخ رؤيا شاملة مغايرة للكون والحياة والإنسان.    ويلاحظ الباحث أن شعراء الحداثة العربية انطلقوا في حركتهم الثورية تلك، ليس نتيجة حراكٍ تاريخي ثقافيٍ عربي محض، إنما تحت مظلة التأثير الشعري لكل من عزرا باوند وإليوت وسوزان برنار وبودلير ورامبو ولوتريامون واديث ستويل وغيرهم من شعراء الغرب ونقاده، وقد توالت اعترافات شعراء الحداثة بهذا التأثير بصراحة ووضوح.    كذلك يمكن القول، إن الاتكاءَ على المساحةِ الإبداعيةِ الغربية هي التي دفعت الى بروزِ الرموزِ في الشعرِ العربي المعاصر، ويعني هذا بالتالي، أن التأثرَ بالنصوصِ كانت هي بدورِها، نتيجةَ التأثرِ بالآخرِ .    ويمضي الكاتب قائلا: الشاعر العربي أخذ يحاول أن يستعيد مكانته ككائن رؤيوي، وأخذ الشعر يستعيد وظيفته الرؤيوية/ ولعل من هنا انفتح الباب على علاقة مختلفة بين الشعر والدين.    اما أبرز مميزات التجربة الشعرية الحداثية العربية التي اشار اليها الكاتب فهي الخروج عن الذاتية التي وسمت القصيدة الرومنطيقية، وسعيها الحثيث للتعبير عن قضايا الإنسان المعاصر، وأزمته الروحية العميقة.    ولعل هذا ما دفع الشاعر الحداثي للعودة إلى لعب الدور الذي برز فيه في بداية الحضارة الإنسانية. كذلك عاد الشعر إلى مكانته الحقيقية في التراث البشري بما هو كشف ورؤيا تنير آفاقًا جديدة وتكشف حقائق الحياة وتلامس كبد الوجود.    ويرى الكاتب ان الشعر العربي الحديث لم يستخدم في بعضِ نماذجه التي تناولها البحث، الرمز الديني بشكلٍ عابرٍ أو بسيط، بل صهر هذه الرموز ضمن حدس واعٍ يتوسد الرؤية الاستشرافية والاستيعاب النقدي للماضي، قوامه الرؤية التي تنفذ عبر مظاهر الواقع إلى الحقائق الجوهرية للوجود، وتعبر عن نفسها تعبيرًا مجازيًا يصل ذروته بالنموذج الأصلي والقصص الأسطورية.    ويؤكد الكاتب ان المعادلة انقلبت مع الشعر الحداثي. وانفلت الشاعر من سطوة النص وسلطته، وحاول إنتاج نصٍ شعريٍّ يعكس فيه آلام الإنسان، وعذابه الوجودي، واحتجاجاته الأخلاقية على الظلم والاضطهاد، مشيرا الى ان الشاعر الحديث سعى جاهدًا - من خلال بناء عالم قصيدته - إلى أن يكون مركزها الإنسان وسعى للتعبير عن وضعِه المأساوي السوداوي إزاء اشتراطاتٍ اجتماعيةٍ وسياسية قاسية، وللتعبير عن غربته وضياعه في هذا العالم، فبعد أن كانت القصيدة في السابق تتمحور حول الأعلى، وتدور في فلكه، أو تهرب من الواقع نحو الطبيعة والسكينة والرتابة، جاء الشاعر الحديث ليعكس الاتجاه، وبدل أن يتجه من الأسفل إلى الأعلى، أو من الذات إلى الأمام - الوراء، بات الاتجاه من الأعلى إلى الأسفل، ومن الأمام إلى الذات - الـ نحن.    لكن السؤال الذي طرحه البحث: لمَ كان التركيز على أسطورة أدونيس في الشعر العربي المعاصر،؟. إذا كان من الصعوبةِ بمكان مساءلة الشاعر الحديث لمَ اعتمد هذا، وركن ذاك جانبًا؟ إلا أنّ دارسي الأدب العربي الحديث وضعوا هذا في خانة الأسطورة، وغضّوا الطرف عن كون هذا رمزا .    وهذا ما أدى، بالتالي، إلى نسبة فاعلية هذه الرموز الدينية في النص الشعري على أساس أنها أسطورة وليست دينية، مما يعني انزياحًا مقصودًا لهذه الرموز، وتوظيفًا لها ضمن أطرٍ غير واضحة الحدود.    لكن، يقول كامل صالح في كتابه، انه يمكن فهم ارتكاز الشاعر العربي الحداثي على الرمز أو الأسطوري، بمقاربة الوضع الذي كان يمرّ على العالم العربي، ولا يزال، من ضياع فلسطين إلى استبداد السلطة، إلى الفقر والحروب، ويمكن الوقوف على أهمية هذه الرموزِ وإيحاءاتها في شعرٍ عربي يحاول أن يبثّ خطابه الرافض من خلال القصيدة، إذ تماهى الشاعر الحديث متمثلاً دوره لإنقاذ شعبه، جاعلاً من قصيدته درب جلجلة تحتضر الحياة فيها لتعودَ من جديدٍ نضرةً خالية من الشر، وتحملُ الخلاص للجميع. فالإنسانُ المعاصرُ يعيشُ في حالةِ عقمٍ وجدب، لذا على الشاعر أن يكونَ هو الجديد الذي يفدي بنقائه الأمثل انحطاط القرن العشرين، كما يقول الناقد غالي شكري، ذلك بعد أن انبحّ فينا الصوت ، على حد تعبير يوسف الخال.

"title : The hot house: life inside Leavenworth Prison - author : Pete Earleycategory : poetrydescription : Author of the acclaimed Family of Spies, Pete Earley is the first writer ever permitted unlimited access to America's oldest federal prison. Out of the iron belly of this maximum-security penitentiary comes his stunning account of life behind bars--the nation's hardest criminals doing hard time... It's a self-contained metropolis behind vast walls built in 1895; a lethal place governed by ruthless clans competing for dominance. Murder is frequent, rape is less for sex than for power, and respect is the coin of the realm. Once disrespected, a Leavenworth inmate has two choices: he can submit to virtual slavery--or he can fight his antagonist until one of them dies.  Nicknamed ""the Hot House"" because of the sweltering conditions of its cellblocks, the federal penitentiary in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, seethes with the pervasive threat of riot. It is the most dreaded facility in the system--not because of its maximum-security rating, but because of its fierce population: sociopathic gangsters, Aryan Nation neo-Nazi killers, muscle toughs, ruthless narcotics profiteers, and heavyset bikers pockmarked with bullet wounds like acne scars. Even the shaven-legged ""punks,"" the drunks, and the junkies may be carrying homemade ""shank"" knives under their shirts.  Pete Earley, celebrated investigative reporter, conducted literally hundreds of hours of interviews, all but living inside the primordial world of Leavenworth. Out of this extraordinary firsthand access, as well as essential documents, telephone transcripts, and prison files, comes the riveting story of what life is actually like inside this most famous of prisons. The Hot House depicts the gulf between the thinking of us ""Square Johns"" and the inmates--people a Hot House prison psychologist termed as having ""only two emotions, fear and anger. Everything these inmates do revolves around those two emotions and nothing else."".  The Hot House focuses on a few of the ""star"" players in Leavenworth: among them Carl Cletus Bowles, the sexual predator with a talent for murder; Dallas Scott, a gang member who, at age forty-two, has spent almost thirty of those years behind bars; Warden Robert Matthews, who put his shoulder against his prison's immovable grim reality; Thomas Silverstein, a sociopath confined in ""no human contact status"" since 1983; and William Post, a bank robber with a criminal record going back to when he was eight years old, and the nickname ""Catman"" because he takes devoted care of the cats that live inside Leavenworth. The inmates are kept under control by an enormous staff of guards, whose main job is to keep the turf wars at bay and quell riots before they erupt.  Not only a gripping account of real men behind bars and those who control them, Pete Earley's book is also a startling meditation on national prison policy. The United States has the dubious distinction of locking up the highest percentage of its population of any country in the world. The subject matter of The Hot House: Life Inside Leavenworth Prison colors our daily lives and fills every night's newscasts. This disquieting book compels wide attention.   Read more Read less"

"title : A poem traveled down my arm: poems and drawings - author : Alice Walkercategory : poetrydescription : In this illuminating book, Pulitzer Prize--winning novelist and acclaimed poet Alice Walker reveals her remarkable philosophy of life.

"title : Make We Merry More and Less - author : Douglas Graycategory : poetrydescription : ""Conceived as a companion volume to the well-received Simple Forms: Essays on Medieval English Popular Literature (2015), Make We Merry More and Less is a comprehensive anthology of popular medieval literature from the twelfth century onwards. Uniquely, the book is divided by genre, allowing readers to make connections between texts usually presented individually.  This anthology offers a fruitful exploration of the boundary between literary and popular culture, and showcases an impressive breadth of literature, including songs, drama, and ballads. Familiar texts such as the visions of Margery Kempe and the Paston family letters are featured alongside lesser-known works, often oral. This striking diversity extends to the language: the anthology includes Scottish literature and original translations of Latin and French texts.  The illuminating introduction offers essential information that will enhance the reader’s enjoyment of the chosen texts. Each of the chapters is accompanied by a clear summary explaining the particular delights of the literature selected and the rationale behind the choices made. An invaluable resource to gain an in-depth understanding of the culture of the period, this is essential reading for any student or scholar of medieval English literature, and for anyone interested in folklore or popular material of the time.

"title : The collector of bodies - author : Diane Glancycategory : poetrydescription : A 1994 trip to Syria and Jordan as an Arts America Speaker for the United States Information Agency began the group of poems for The Collector of Bodies. The manuscript stayed in a file until the Civil War began in Syria, March 18, 2011, the author's 70th birthday. The poems were retrieved, and the manuscript continued. Glancy wrote as an observer--as someone who had talked to the students in the universities--who had experienced a foreboding of what was ahead for Syria, especially after listening to the unrest of the students. In the bright sunlight, as they walked toward her, smiling, she felt an inexplicable point of grief. She heard the desire of the people to be free. Later, following the uprising of civil war on the news, she knew she was seeing the price the Syrians would pay for that desire. A visit to a foreign country leaves part of oneself in that place. But something in return is taken. This collection of poems explores the ""something that is taken"" with implications for the Christian believer and the issues involved. What can be done in a world full of refugees? Is there anything to do other than stand back and watch? -- back cover.   Read more Read less"

"title : Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám - author : Omar Khayyamcategory : poetrydescription : Omar Khayyám was an eleventh-century Persian poet, mathematician, and astronomer.  Renowned in his own time for his scientific achievements, his fame was reborn in the nineteenth century when Edward Fitzgerald published a translation of his rubáiyát (quatrains in a style popular among Persian intellectuals of his day). Fitzgerald's first translation was first published anonymously in 1859. (His revised editions were published in 1868, 1872, and 1879). FitzGerald's translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is perhaps the most frequently read Victorian poem of all time.   Read more Read less"

"title : If Not, Winter - author : Sapphocategory : poetrydescription : A bilingual edition of the work of the Greek poet Sappho, in a new translation by Anne Carson.Sappho lived on the island of Lesbos from about 630 b.c. She was a musical genius who devoted her life to composing and performing songs. Of the nine books of lyrics Sappho is said to have composed, none of the music is extant and only one poem has survived complete. All the rest are fragments. In If Not, Winter Carson presents all of Sappho's fragments in Greek and in English. Brackets and space give the reader a sense of what is absent as well as what is present on the papyrus. Carson's translation illuminates Sappho's reflections on love, desire, marriage, exile, cushions, bees, old age, shame, time, chickpeas and many other aspects of the human situation.From the Hardcover edition.

العربية إلى ضفتي البحر المتوسط د. نضير الخزرجي  تختلف الأغراض الشعرية وتتنوع مقاصده من جيل الى آخر ومن حقبة الى أخرى، ويترك النظام السياسي الحاكم أثره الكبير في عناوين الشعر ومساحاته وفضاءاته، كما يترك الزمن بصماته على الشعر فيتلمسه بحنان او ينشب أظافره فيه، فترى البعض من الشعراء اذا ما هوى نظام وقام آخر، صرعى على مذبح السلطان يسبح بدمائه يقدم ضريبة الولاء للسابق ورفض اللاحق، وبعضهم يتلون مع صبغة النظام يتحرك حيثما هبت الريح وحيثما حطت الأمور رحالها، يتبضع بقوافيه يملأ جيوبه من صفراء هذا النظام وبيضاء ذاك النظام، فهو في كل واد يهيم، لا يهمه اهتزاز عرش قوافيه ما سلم معاشه، وإنْ كان بذلك تثبيت عرش سلطان جائر، فليس كل شاعر دعبل بن علي الخزاعي (ت 246هـ) يحمل على ظهره خشبته ينتظر نصف قرن من يصلبه عليها بتهمة الولاء للحق والتغني بقوافي الحرية.    ولعل القرن السابع الهجري يشكل علامة بارزة في تاريخ الأدب العربي بعامة والقريض منه بخاصة، لاسيما وإنه شهد سقوط دول ودويلات وقيام أخرى على أنقاضها، ومن الطبيعي وفي هذه الأجواء الحساسة المليئة بالمفاجآت أن يسطع نجم شاعر ويأفل نجم آخر، وهجرة الشعر وانتقال الشعراء الى بلدان أخرى. وهذا ما يحاول أنْ يثيره الدكتور الشيخ محمد صادق الكرباسي في كتابه ""ديوان القرن السابع"" الخاص بالمنظوم في الامام الحسين (ع) من الشعر القريض، والصادر في لندن عن المركز الحسيني للدراسات، في 365 صفحة من القطع الوزيري.  • اهتزاز عرش القوافي    فسنوات القرن السابع الهجري (29/8/1204- 5/9/1301م)، كانت حبلى بالحوادث والوقائع، حيث انقرضت الدولة الأيوبية في مصر (647 هـ)، والدولة العباسية في بغداد (656 هـ) والدولة الزنكية في الموصل (657 هـ) والدولة الموحدية في تونس (667 هـ). وفي المقابل قامت الدولة الحفصية في تونس (627 هـ) ودولة بني الأحمر الخزرجية في الأندلس (635 هـ) ودولة المماليك البحرية في مصر (648 هـ)، والدولة المغولية الإيلخانية في ايران (649 هـ) التي قامت على أنقاض الدولة الخوارزمشاهية، والدولة العباسية الثانية في مصر (659 هـ)، وقيام الدولة العثمانية في الأناضول (680 هـ) على أنقاض الدولة السلجوقية، وغير ذلك من الحوادث والكوارث التي حلت بالمسلمين.    ويوعز المحقق الكرباسي انحسار موجة الأدب في القرن السابع الهجري الى أسباب عدة، أهمها:    أولا: كثرة الحوادث والفتن التي أنهكت قوى المسلمين في سائر الأقطار الاسلامية.    ثانيا: زيادة الكوارث الطبيعية والأمراض الفتاكة التي أدت الى شيوع القحط والغلاء.    ثالثا: اهتمام المماليك البحرية في مصر بالفن والعمران والبناء أكثر من اهتمامهم بالأدب والشعر.    رابعا: انتقال العاصمة الاسلامية من بغداد الى الأناضول ثم استانبول، ما أدى الى توزع الحواضر العلمية والأدبية.    خامسا: انتشار أدب النثر والتأليف والتصنيف وفن القصص كبديل عن الشعر، ما ساعد على انحسار رقعة الشعر. لكنه في الوقت نفسه يلاحظ انتشار فن الموشحات والمقامات، على أنَّ ابتعاد الحكام من التتر والمماليك والعثمانيين عن اللغة العربية الأثر المساعد في انحدار الشعر عن مكانته الأدبية والسياسية.    وخلاصة الأمر إنَّ عرش القوافي أصابه الاهتزاز بسبب ضعف قوائمه وعدم إسناد الأسر الحاكمة للشعر ودعم الشعراء، وعزوف بعضها عن الأدب العربي لأنها جاءت من محيط غير عربي، وانشغال بعضها بالحروب الداخلية بين دوائر العائلة الحاكمة الواحدة.  • قوافي العرب في الأندلس    كانت الطلائع الأولى التي فتحت الأندلس عام 92هـ قادمة من العراق، وهذه الطلائع فيها الى جانب العسكر رجال أدب وثقافة، وكان لهم الدور الكبير في انتشار الأدب العربي في البلدان الأوروبية التي بدأت تفتح الواحدة بعد الأخرى حتى سيطرة الأسبان على الأندلس في العام 898هـ، ومن ذلك الأدب الحسيني الذي يبث في النفوس روح التحدي والاستشهاد من أجل سلامة الأهداف السامية والقيم العالية.    وبناءاً على رأي المؤرخين فإنَّ الأدب العربي في الأندلس شهد تطورا على حكم الأمويين (138-316 هـ)، وتراوح مكانه تحت حكم المروانيين في الأندلس (216-422 هـ)، وبدأ يشرئب بعنقه ويزدهر في عصر ملوك الطوائف (422-484 هـ)، وفي الجانب الآخر من البحر الأبيض المتوسط إزدهر الأدب في شمال أفريقية أيام حكم الأدارسة (172-363 هـ) واستمر في أيام الفاطميين (291-555 هـ).    ويرى المحقق الكرباسي أنَّه: ""وفي ظل حكومة ملوك الطوائف وبفضل دولة بني حمود (407-449 هـ) ظهر التشيع في الأندلس بعدما كان فاشيا في أفريقية في عهد الأدارسة والفاطميين واستمر الأمر على هذه الحالة على عهد دولة الموحدين (515-667 هـ) التي حكمت شمال أفريقية والأندلس أيضا، ومع ظهور التشيع وانتشاره ظهر الشعر الحسيني وانتشر في المغرب الاسلامي بشكل عام"".    ويعود الشعر الحسيني في الأندلس في بعض جذوره الى هروب عدد من الموالين بمن فيهم الشعراء من المشرق الاسلامي الى مغربه، وكان من إفرازات الهجرة ظهور انتفاضات وثورات عدة في الأندلس، كما ساعد سقوط الدولة المروانية الأموية في الأندلس وقيام دولة الحموديين على نشر فكر أهل البيت (ع) وبالتالي انتشار الأدب الحسيني بما فيه الشعر، وقبل ذلك كان الأمويون يقتلون من يوالي أهل البيت (ع)، وهذا ما يؤرخه الرحالة المقدسي محمد بن احمد (ت 380 هـ) في كتابه ""أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم"" حيث يؤكد في (ص 322): ""إنَّ الأندلسيين – الأمويين منهم – إذا عثروا على شيعي فربما قتلوه""، واستخدام المقدسي كلمة (عثروا) دلالة على عظم الجريمة بإشهار الشيعي ولاءه لأهل البيت في ظل حكم الأمويين!    ويرى البعض كما يشير الكرباسي: ""إنَّ من أسباب دخول التشيع في الأندلس بل جميع بلاد المغرب العربي هو رحلة عدد من الأندلسيين الى المشرق الاسلامي ويعتبرون الأعشى القرطبي المتوفى عام 221 هـ من أوائلهم فقد رحل عام 179 الى العراق المركز الشيعي ثم رحل بعده عباس الثقفي (ت 238 هـ) الذي أوفده عبد الرحمان الأوسط (176-238 هـ) عام 201 هـ في التماس الكتب القديمة"". ورويدا رويدا أخذ الناس بالأندلس في إقامة مجالس العزاء في عاشوراء ذكرى استشهاد الامام الحسين (ع)، وفي هذا يقول المؤرخ عمر بن عبد الله فروخ (ت 1407 هـ) في تاريخ الأدب العربي: 6/130، وهو يتحدث عن الأدب في الأندلس والمغرب: ""من المناسبات التي كان أهل الأندلس والمغرب يحتفلون بها ذكرى عاشوراء التي كانت بها مأساة عاشوراء ومقتل الحسين بن علي رضي الله عنه"".    ولا خصوصية للأدب الحسيني في المغرب الاسلامي عما كان عليه في المنشأ في المشرق الاسلامي، كما يذهب بذلك الشيخ الكرباسي، ولم يختلف الاتجاه الأدبي كما: ""إنَّ الأغراض الشعرية ظلت كما هي ولم تتغير بشكل عام ويعترف الجميع بأنَّ الشعر بالذات وصل أوجه في الأندلس في عصر المماليك وبسقوطهم انحط الشعر انحطاطا كبيرا لابتعاد المرابطين – البربر- عن العربية، وفي شمال أفريقيا وصل الشعر أوجه بعد المرابطين حين وصل الموحدون الى السلطة وكان للشعر الحسيني بالذات أرضية خصبة"".  • أسماء لامعة    ومع ان الأدب العربي بعامة والحسيني بخاصة أصابه ما أصاب الوضع السياسي من مد وجزر، نتيجة: ""الأوضاع المتردية في مجمل الأقطار الإسلامية وبالأخص تلك الاضطرابات التي هزت القلب والمناطق الوسطى من الخارطة الإسلامية""، فإنَّ الشعر الحسيني ظل: ""ينشد من هنا وهناك وصوته يدوي في أرجاء الديار الإسلامية""، وفي الوقت نفسه فان ما يلاحظ على الشعر الحسيني في هذا القرن أنَّ الشعر القادم من المغرب الإسلامي فاق الشعر المنظوم في المشرق الإسلامي، حيث: ""بلغ مجموع من وصلنا اسمه من الشعراء الحسينيين من بلاد المغرب الإسلامي في هذا القرن ستة وعشرون شاعرا وهو كبير في قبال شعراء العراق البالغ عددهم أربعة عشر شاعرا وشعراء مصر البالغ عددهم ثمانية ومثلها من شعراء الشام بغض النظر عن سائر الشعراء"".    ولاحظ المصنف أنَّ القرن السابع الهجري شهد تنوعا فريدا في وظائف الشعراء وجنسياتهم، إذ كان فيهم الفقيه والقاضي والأمير والوزير والرحالة والكاتب والأديب توزعوا على اسبانيا وإيران والبرتغال وتونس والجزائر والجزيرة العربية وسوريا والعراق وفلسطين وليبيا ومصر والمغرب واليمن وغيرها. فيشار بالبنان الى القاضي السعيد ابن سناء الملك هبة الله بن جعفر السعدي (ت 608هـ) وهو من خريجي مدرسة أبي تمام حبيب بن أوس الطائي (ت 231 هـ) وأبي الطيب المتنبي أحمد بن الحسين (ت 354 هـ): ""وقالوا بأنه أشهر وأجود من نظم من المشارقة في الموشحات وكان صاحب نظرية موسيقية فيها"". ومن شعره الحسيني قوله في قصيدة أنشأها في مدح القاضي الفاضل عبد الرحيم بن علي اللخمي (ت 596 هـ)، من الشعر المتقارب ومطلعها:    مديحك كالمسك لا يكتتم  به يبتدى وبه يختتم    ثم يقول:    وما ضيّع اللهُ آل الحسينِ  إذا رفع الدهرُ آل الحَكَم    فالشاعر يحاول أنْ يخفف عن القاضي الفاضل تخليه عن القضاء والوزارة في الدولة الأيوبية، فيجري مقارنة بين آل الحسين وآل الحكم، حيث رفع الله الأسرة الأولى وان بان ان الدهر رفع الثانية.    ويشار الى الأمير العيوني علي بن المقرب (ت 629هـ) وهو من خريجي مدرسة أبي تمام والمتنبي والنابغة زياد بن معاوية الذبياني (ت 18 ق هـ)، وهو صاحب القصيدة العينية من 87 بيتا في رثاء الإمام الحسين، يقول من الرجز التام ومطلعها:    يا باكيا لدِمنةٍ وأربُعِ  إبكِ على آل النبيّ أو دَعِ    ثم يقول:    وإنّ حُزني لقتيلِ كربلا  ليس على طول المدى بمُقلِعِ    إذا ذكرتُ يومَهُ تحدّرت  مدامعي لأربَـعٍ في أربَـعِ    ويشار الى الحكيم المتكلم ابن أبي الحديد عبد الحميد بن محمد المدائني المعتزلي (ت 656 هـ)، وهو صاحب شرح نهج البلاغة، وصاحب القصيدة العلوية وهي واحدة من سبع قصائد سميت بالقصائد العلويات السبع، يقول فيها من الطويل في مدح الإمام علي (ع) ثم يأتي على واقعة كربلاء، ومطلعها:    لمن ظعن بين الغميم فحاجر  بزغن شموساً في ظلام الدياجر    الى ان يصل مورد الشاهد، فيقول:    فيا لك مقتولاً تهدّمتِ العلى  وثُلّت به أركانُ عرشِ المفاخر    ثم يقول:    أما كان في رُزء ابن فاطمَ مُقتَضٍ  هبوطَ رواسٍٍ أو كُسوفَ زواهرِ    ولكنما غـدرُ النفوس سجيـةٌ  لها وعزيزٌ صاحبُ غـيرُ غـادرِ    ويشار الى الإمام البوصيري محمد بن سعيد (ت 694 هـ) صاحب البردة الميمية في مدح النبي محمد (ص). وفي قصيدة له في مدح السيدة نفيسة بنت الحسن الأنور بن زيد الأبلج بن الإمام الحسن (ع) (ت 208هـ)، ينشد من الطويل ويعرج فيها على الإمام الحسين (ع) وأهل بيته، ومطلعها:    جنابُك منه تستفيد الفوائد  وللناس بالإحسان منك عوائد    ثم يقول:    وطُفِّفَ يومَ الطّفِّ كيلُ ذمائكم  إذا الدمُّ جارٍ فيه والدمعُ جامدُ    ويلاحظ أنَّ الفقيه والشاعر الشيخ ابن نما جعفر بن محمد الربعي الحلي (ت 680 هـ) قد استأثر بتسع عشرة قصيدة وقطعة وبيت من مجموع 94 قطعة من بين 52 شخصاً ضمهم ديوان القرن السابع الهجري. ومن قصيدة له من الطويل ينعى ديار آل رسول الله (ص) وقد خلت من ساكنيها، فينشد:    وقفتُ على دار النـبيّ محمدٍ  فألفـيتُها قد أقفرت عرصاتها    وأمست خلاءً من تلاوةِ قارئٍ  وعُطّلَ فيها صومُها وصلاتُها    إلى أنْ يقول:    فعيني لقتل السبطِ عبرى ولوعتي  على فقدهم ما تنقضي زَفَراتها    فيا كبدي كم تصبرين على الأذى  أما آن أن يُغني إذاً حسراتُها    ومن المفارقات أنَّ الشيخ ابن نما صاحب كتاب ""مثير الأحزان"" والذي مات على الولاء لأهل البيت، دفع ضريبة هذا الولاء ليس في حياته فحسب، بل وحتى وهو ثاويا في لحده، فقد تعرض قبره في الحلة بتاريخ 13/8/2005م الى عملية تخريبية لغرض هدمه، أدى العمل الإرهابي الى سقوط عشرين مواطنا عراقيا بين قتيل وجريح.  • ظاهرة الشعر الملمع    ويسجل الدكتور الكرباسي ظاهرة طرأت على الشعر العربي القريض في القرن السابع الهجري على يد الشاعر الفارسي جلال الدين الرومي محمد بن محمد البلخي (611-672هـ) بخاصة، وإنْ كانت بذورها غرست في القرن السادس الهجري، وهو ظهور ""الشعر الملمع"" المتضمن لمقاطع من الشعر غير العربي يرد فيه شطر أو بيت من الشعر العربي، وهذا النمط من الشعر: ""ظهر من جراء اختلاط المسلمين من قوميات شتى بعضهم بالبعض الآخر نتيجة الفتوحات الإسلامية وأخذوا شيئا فشيئا يستخدمون المفردات العربية في النثر والشعر"".    ومثال ذلك قول الرومي:    راح بفيـها والـروح فيـها  كي أشتـهيها قم فاسقنيها    إين راز يارست إين ناز يارست  أواز يارست قم فاسقنيها    أي: (هذا سر الحبيب، هذا دلال الحبيب، نداء الحبيب قم فاسقنيها).    ولأنَّ الأدب الحسيني دخل في كل ثقافات الشعوب الداخلة في الإسلام، فان هذه الظاهرة شملته وبخاصة لدى الفرس والأتراك والهنود، وأصبحت هذه الظاهرة سائدة في النظم، ومثال ذلك:    شيعتي ما إن شربتم  عذب ماء فاذكروني    أو سمعتـم بقتـيل  أو شهيد فاندبـوني    مَن شهيـد كربلايم سَر بُريـده أز قفايم    أي: (أنا شهيد كربلا، مقطوع الرأس من القفا)، حيث يحكي الشاعر الفارسي على لسان الإمام الحسين (ع)، وما حلّ به، أما البيتان الأولان فمنسوبان للإمام الحسين (ع).  • يوم الشهيد العالمي    تتخذ الأمم المتحضرة أياما في السنة للاحتفال بمناسبة أو مناسبات معينة تحتفل بها لتخليد ذكرى حدث أو شخص، وكلما مرت السنين تجددت الذكرى، ولعل من أهم أغراض الاحتفال هو تخليد الذكرى تأسيا بها إن كانت تحمل معها بذور آمالها أو منعا لحصول أمثالها أنْ كانت ذكرى تحمل معها بذور آلامها، ولا ذكرى أعظم من ذكرى عاشوراء، لتخليد يوم الشهيد العالمي، حيث لا يوم كيوم أبي عبد الله الحسين (ع) استشهد فيه وأهل بيته وأصحابه.    ومنذ زمن بعيد نادى الأحرار بتخليد الشهيد يوم عاشوراء من كل عام، للاحتفاء بشهداء البشرية ولمنع تجدد نزيف الدماء، وتبارى الشعراء الى تخليد هذا اليوم ومطالبة العالم بتخليده وتكريم الشهيد، ومن ذلك نداء الشاعر السوري كمال العباسي المتوفى بعد العام 656 هـ ينشد من الطويل قائلا في عزاء سيف الدين علي بن عمر المشد المتوفى في المحرم عام 656 هـ والمدفون بسفح جبل قاسيون:    أيا يوم عاشورا جعلت مصيبة  لفقد كريم أو عظيم مبجل    وقد كان في قتل الحسين كفايةٌ  فقد جاءَ الرزء المعظّم في علي    وهذا اليوم الكبير الذي قال فيه فقيه الحنفية وشاعرها محمد بن عبد المنعم التنوخي المتوفى عام 669 هـ، في قصيدة من الكامل في نعي سيف الدين علي بن عمر المشد، ومطلعها:    أأخي أي دجنة أو أزمة  كانت بغير السيف عنا تنجلي    الى ان يصل مورد الشاهد:    عاشورُ يومٌ قد تعاظَمَ ذنبُـهُ  إذ حلَّ فيه كل خطب معضل    لم يكفه قتل الحسين وما جرى حتى تعدّى بالمصاب على علي    من هنا فان الفقيه آية الله الشيخ محمد صادق الكرباسي الذي انفرد في عصرنا بتتبع آثار النهضة الحسينية يرى أنَّ يوم العاشر من محرم الحرام هو رمز للشهادة وهو يوم المصائب، ولذلك فان: ""من الإنصاف أن يتخذ هذا اليوم يوما عالمياً لتكريم الشهيد من اجل الحق، فلولا شهادة طلاب الحق لما قامت للإنسانية قائمة ولا بقيت للكرامة مصداقية"".  • تشبيهات كربلائية    ولأن مصاب الإمام الحسين (ع) لا يعلوه مصاب، فهو مصاب الإنسانية جمعاء، فان كل إنسان على وجه الأرض صاحب مصاب وعزاء، يحاول أن يقترب من مصاب الحسين بان يجعل ما حلّ به من مصاب يناظر مصاب الإمام الحسين (ع)، وهذا المعنى يظهر بجلاء في شعر الرثاء، على ان صاحب المصاب مهما علا شأنه وارتفع كعب مقامه، لا يمكن قياس مصابه بمصاب الحسين (ع) ابدا، ولكنها مقاربة رثائية تجري على لسان الشاعر لبيان عظم المصاب وخطره.    فهذا الشاعر عبد الرحمان بن إسماعيل المقدسي (ت 665 هـ) يرثي الملك الكامل محمد بن غازي الذي قطع التتر رأسه ومن معه سنة 658 هـ بعد ان استولوا على الشام، وطافوا برأسه في الأزقة ثم دفن في مسجد الرأس الشريف في دمشق، فينشد من الخفيف:    ابن غازٍ غزا وجاهدَ قوماً  أثخنوا في العراق والمشرِقَين    ثم يقول:    لم يَشِنهُ إذ طـيفَ بالرأس منـه  فله أسوةُ بـرأس الحسينِ    وافق السبطَ في الشهادة والحمـ  ـل لقد حاز أجره مرتين    وهذا الشاعر ابن الساعاتي علي بن رستم الخراساني (ت 604 هـ)، يرثي فقد ولده محمود، فيقول في قصيدة من الكامل ومطلعها:    لا تنكري سقمي ولا تسهيدي  أبلى جديد الدهر كل جديد    الى أن يقول:    ولكلّ حَيٍّ أسـوةٌ بمحـمدٍ  ومحمدٌ ذو الموقف المحمود    كم في مصارع آله من عبرةٍ  سوداءَ عدّوها من التسويد    فتأسَّ بالمأموم والمسموم والـ  ـمقتول والمجلوب نحو يزيد    فالمأموم إشارة الى الإمام علي (ع) حيث أصبح مأموما بصرف الخلافة عنه وهو الإمام بنص الغدير، والمسموم إشارة الى الإمام الحسن (ع) الذي مات بالسم، والمقتول إشارة الى الإمام الحسين الشهيد بكربلاء، والمجلوب إشارة الى الإمام علي بن الحسين السجاد الذي جلب مأسورا الى الشام مع رحل الإمام الحسين (ع).    ويستقرئ المحقق الكرباسي من جملة قصائد ومتابعة للتراث الإسلامي، أن التأسي بمصاب الحسين (ع) أصبح سنة في المجتمعات المسلمة: ""ولعل هذه هي بداية لترسيخ العادة المتبعة عند الموالين لأهل البيت (ع) في التذكير بمصاب سيد الشهداء عند مصابهم والتي تحولت فيما بعد الى قراءة سيرة الإمام الحسين (ع) في مجالس العزاء على أمواتهم والتي تطورت أيضا الى تخصيص قراءة مقتل علي الأكبر - نجل الإمام الحسين – مثلا فيما إذا كان المتوفى شابا والى ذكر مصائب السيدة زينب (ع) مثلا فيما إذا كانت المتوفاة امرأة وهلمجرا"".    ولأن الاستشهاد في سبيل القيم النبيلة شهادة عالمية لا تختص بدولة أو فئة، فان عاشوراء لا تختص بالشيعي أو السني ولا تختص بالمسلم أو بغيره، وهذه الحقيقة يؤكدها الشعراء، فهذا هبة الله ابن سناء الملك بن جعفر السعدي (ت 608 هـ) يقول في قصيدة من مجزوء الكامل ومطلعها:    جاءت بحسنٍ مطمئن  جاءَت منه بكل فن    الى ان يقول:    ونظمتُها في يوم عا  شوراءَ مِن همّي وحُزني    يومٌ يناسب غَبنَ مَن  قتلوهُ ظلما مثل غَبني    يومٌ يُساءُ به وفيـ  ـه كُلُّ شيعيٍّ وسُنّي  • أدب شجي    ودرج المحقق الكرباسي كما في كل نتاجاته على تضمين الكتاب بعشرات الفهارس في أبواب شتى، ويختمه بقراءة نقدية لواحد من الأعلام، وفي هذا الديوان قراءة للأديب والمؤرخ العراقي، مير شاؤول البصري (1911-2006م)، رئيس اللجنة الإدارية ليهود العراق ورئيس الطائفة الموسوية، صاحب المؤلفات الكثيرة منها: أعلام الأدب في العراق الحديث، وأعلام الوطنية والقومية العربية، وأعلام الكرد، وهو الى ذلك له دواوين شعر. يقول البصري في قراءته إنَّ الموسوعة الحسينية في جانب منها: ""تتناول مناحي أدبية وتاريخية مختلفة، وتجلو صفحات كانت مجهولة من التراجم والآثار والأشعار والأخبار""، ورأى أنَّ الأدب الحسيني التي تهتم بها دائرة المعارف الحسينية هو: ""أدب إنساني شجي يخلّد فاجعة كربلاء التي تردّد ذكرها على مرّ العصور رمزاً للحرية والفداء، قلّما نجد في الآداب العالمية مثالاً لهذا الأدب الذي ارتفعت أصواته من فوق المنابر ورهنت آياته في بطون الكتب وظلّ حيّاً في الصدور وعلى الألسنة مئات الأجيال يثير الشجون ويبكي العيون"". وعنده: ""إنَّ كربلاء كانت ولا تزال مركزا ثقافيا إسلاميا تعاقبت عليها العهود""، مثنيا في الوقت نفسه: ""على جهود الأستاذ الشيخ محمد صادق محمد الكرباسي وتحقيقاته الرائعة المفيدة، وأرجو له مواصلة التوفيق في دائرة معارفه ومساعيه الأدبية الجميلة"".

"title : Strict Wildness - author : Peter Viereckcategory : poetrydescription : ""A reviewer once called Peter Viereck's thought ""not common sense but inspired, electric common sense."" This volume of Viereck's selected essays on poetry and on history, written between 1938 through 2004, exemplifies this quality. Its main theme is suggested in Viereck's coined phrase ""strict wildness,"" which suggests a balance between restraint (which by itself is staid and rigid) and passion (which by itself is incoherent). Frost called free verse tennis without the net. Viereck calls dead mechanical form ""net without the tennis."" Strict wildness, then, is spontaneity of feeling within strict organic form. The book explores questions of modernism and poetic craft with respect to American poetry. It discusses the controversy over Ezra Pound's politics and its relation to his poetics, as well as the nearly forgotten poet Vachel Lindsay. Viereck offers more general views on poetics, including the fruitful tensions between form and content, and the impact of modern technology on poetic expression. He also discusses history and politics, and contains essays on McCarthyism, the Cold War, political conformity of the Left and Right, and discusses issues of historiography and culture that define Viereck's highly individual, often critical brand of conservatism. In treating representative trends and figures in conservative thought, Viereck insists on clear awareness of what exists to conserve, what ought to be conserved, and why it should be conserved. In their range and originality, the writings brought together in Strict Wildness constitute an ideal introduction to Peter Viereck's literary and political thought and how they come together. It will be of interest to literary scholars, intellectual historians, and social scientists. The introduction allows the reader to grasp a clear sense of the context and background of Viereck's works.""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less"
"title : Crush - author : Richard Sikencategory : poetrydescription : Richard Siken's Crush, selected as the 2004 winner of the Yale Younger Poets prize, is a powerful collection of poems driven by obsession and love. Siken writes with ferocity, and his reader hurtles unstoppably with him. His poetry is confessional, gay, savage, and charged with violent eroticism. In the world of American poetry, Siken's voice is striking.  In her introduction to the book, competition judge Louise Glück hails the ""cumulative, driving, apocalyptic power, [and] purgatorial recklessness"" of Siken's poems.

"title : To See the Earth Before the End of the World - author : Ed Robersoncategory : poetrydescription : In To See the Earth Before the End of the World Ed Roberson presents us with 120 new poems, each speaking in his unique voice and seen through his unique eye. Earth and sky, neighborhood life and ancient myths, the art of seeing and the architecture of the imagination are all among the subjects of these poems. Recurring images and ideas construct a complex picture of our world, ourselves, and the manifold connections tying them together. The poems raise large questions about the natural world and our place in it, and they do not flinch from facing up to those questions.  Roberson's poems range widely through different scales of time and space, invoking along the way history and myth, galaxies and garbage trucks, teapots and the history of photography, mating cranes and Chicago's political machine. This collection is composed of five sequences, each developing a particular constellation of images and ideas related to the vision of the whole. Various journeys become one journey—an epic journey, invoking epic themes. There are songs of creation, pictures of the sorrows of war, celebrations of human labor and human society, a respect for tools and domestic utensils that are well made, the deep background of the past tingeing the colors of the present, and the tragic tones of endings and laments, a pervading awareness of the tears in things. Most of all, there is the exhilaration of a grand, sweeping vision that enlarges our world.   Read more Read less"

"title : Ballistics: Poems - author : Billy Collinscategory : poetrydescription : A Billy Collins poem is instantly recognizable. ""Using simple, understandable language,"" notes USA Today, the two-term U.S. Poet Laureate ""captures ordinary life--its pleasure, its discontents, its moments of sadness and of joy."" His everyman approach to writing resonates with readers everywhere and generates fans who would otherwise never give a poem a second glance.Now, in this stunning new collection, Collins touches on a greater array of subjects--love, death, solitude, youth, and aging--delving deeper than ever before. Ballistics comes at the reader full force with moving and playful takes on life. Drawing inspiration from the world around him and from such poetic forebears as Robert Frost, Paul Valery, and eleventh-century poet Liu Yung, Collins drolly captures the essence of an ordinary afternoon: All I do these drawn-out daysis sit in my kitchen at Pheasant Ridgewhere there are no pheasants to be seenand, last time I looked, no ridge.Collins reflects on his solitude:If I lived across the street from myselfand I was sitting in the darkon the edge of the bedat five o'clock in the morning,I might be wondering what the lightwas doing on in my study at this hour.And he meditates on the effects of love:It turns everything into a symbollike a storm that breaks loosein the final chapter of a long novel.And it may add sparkle to a morning,or deepen a night when the bed is ringed with fire.As Collins strives to find truth in the smallest detail, readers are given a fascinating, intimate glimpse into the heart and soul of a brilliantly thoughtful man and exemplary poet.From the Hardcover edition.

"title : The Descent of Alette - author : Alice Notleycategory : poetrydescription : In The Descent of Alette, Alice Notley presents a feminist epic, a bold journey into the deeper realms. Alette, the narrator, finds herself underground, deep beneath the city, where spirits and people ride endlessly on subways, not allowed to live in the world above. Traveling deeper and deeper, she is on a journey of continual transformation, encountering a series of figures and undergoing fragmentations and metamorphoses as she seeks to confront the Tyrant and heal the world. Using a new measure, with rhythmic units indicated by quotation marks, Notley has created a ""spoken"" text, a rich and mesmerizing work of imagination, mystery, and power.   Read more Read less"

In addressing these themes, the poems also raise questions about art, politics, citizenship, and moral responsibility. The anthology brings together some of the most compelling poetic voices from different regions of Ukraine.

The Glance taps a major, yet little explored theme in Rumi's poetry-the mystical experience that occurs in the meeting of the eyes of the lover and the beloved, parent and child, friend and soul mate.Coleman Barks's new translations of these powerful and complex poems capture Rumi's range from the ethereal to the everyday. They reveal the unique place of human desire, love, and ecstasy, where there exists not just the union of two souls, but the crux of the universe.Here is a new kind of love lyric for our time-one of longing, connection, and wholeness.

"title : The Burial at Thebes: a version of Sophocles' Antigone - author : Seamus Heaneycategory : poetrydescription : Sophocles' play stands as a timely exploration of the conflict between those who affirm the individual's human rights and those who must protect the state's security. During the War of the Seven Against Thebes, Antigone learns that her brothers have killed each other, having been forced onto opposing sides. When Creon, king of Thebes, grants burial of one but not the ""treacherous"" other, Antigone defies his order, believing it her duty to bury all of her close kin. Enraged, Creon condemns her to death, and his soldiers wall her up in a tomb. In this new translation, Seamus Heaney exposes the darkness and the humanity in Sophocles' masterpiece, and inks it with his own modern and masterly touch.   Read more Read less"

A daughter tends to aging parents. A woman struggles with infertility--""What if, instead of carrying / a child, I am supposed to carry grief?""--and a body seized by pain and vertigo as well as ecstasy. A nation convulses: ""Every song of this country / has an unsung third stanza, something brutal."" And still Limón shows us, as ever, the persistence of hunger, love, and joy, the dizzying fullness of our too-short lives. ""Fine then, / I'll take it,"" she writes. ""I'll take it all."" In Bright Dead Things, Limón showed us a heart ""giant with power, heavy with blood""--""the huge beating genius machine / that thinks, no, it knows, / it's going to come in first."" In her follow-up collection, that heart is on full display--even as The Carrying continues further and deeper into the bloodstream, following the hard-won truth of what it means to live in an imperfect world.""--Publisher's website.

"title : The New Black - author : Evie Shockleycategory : poetrydescription : Winner of the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award (2012)  Smart, grounded, and lyrical, Evie Shockley’s the new black integrates powerful ideas about “blackness,” past and present, through the medium of beautifully crafted verse. the new black sees our racial past inevitably shaping our contemporary moment, but struggles to remember and reckon with the impact of generational shifts: what seemed impossible to people not many years ago—for example, the election of an African American president—will have always been a part of the world of children born in the new millennium. All of the poems here, whether sonnet, mesostic, or deconstructed blues, exhibit a formal flair. They speak to the changes we have experienced as a society in the last few decades—changes that often challenge our past strategies for resisting racism and, for African Americans, ways of relating to one another. The poems embrace a formal ambiguity that echoes the uncertainty these shifts produce, while reveling in language play that enables readers to “laugh to keep from crying.” They move through nostalgia, even as they insist on being alive to the present and point longingly towards possible futures.

"title : Marrow - author : darlene anita scottcategory : poetrydescription : ""Grape is the sweetest betrayal. There is no removing the stain Of it say moms everywhere & Even if kids choose it last; They choose it, as loyal To its sugar as any....""  When authorities converged on the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, known as Jonestown, in Guyana on November 18, 1978, more than 900 members were found dead, the result of murder-suicide. The massacre, led by cult leader James ""Jim"" Jones, was the largest mass loss of American lives before September 11, 2001. Yet this event is largely absent in American history. When the mass suicides are remembered, it is usually comically or instructively: ""Don't drink the Kool-Aid,"" as the majority of those who died that day drank or were injected with grape flavored Flavor-Aid.  Much has been documented about this tragic day and how the congregants were killed, yet little is written about the individuals and their lived experiences. In this profound and provocative poetry collection, darlene anita scott corrects that which has been disremembered and honors the people who perished. She elevates and gives voice to the children, teenagers, and adults whose hopes, dreams, and lives were just as hopeful and mundane as any others yet have been overlooked and overshadowed by the other focuses of history. The distinct, haunting, and unforgettable poems in Marrow cut to the bone while also acknowledging and giving tribute to those who died on that fateful day.   Read more Read less"

The preserved corpus of these texts is characterised by a rather uniform language and many recurring themes, thus making the establishment of chronological priorities a difficult task. The editors have brought together scholars working on these texts from both a linguistic and a literary perspective to address the problem. Some contributions offer statistical analysis of the linguistic material or linguistic analysis of subgenres within epic, others use a neoanalytical approach to the history of epic themes or otherwise seek to track the development and interrelationship of epic contents. All the contributors focus on the implications of their study for the dating of early epic poems relative to each other.

Nine Gates begins with a close examination of the roots of poetic craft in ""the mind of concentration"" and concludes by exploring the writer's role in creating a sense of community that is open, inclusive and able to bind the individual and the whole in a way that allows each full self-expression. in between, Nine Gates illumines the nature of originality, translation, the various strategies by which meaning unfolds itself in language, poetry's roots in oral memory and the importance of the shadow to good art. A person who enters completely into the experience of a poem is initiated into a deeper intimacy with life. Delving into the nature of poetry, Jane Hirshfield also writes on the nature of the human mind, perception and experience. Nine Gates is about the underpinnings of poetic craft, but it is also about a way of being alive in the world -- alertly, musically, intelligently, passionately, permeably. In part a primer for the general reader, Nine Gates is also a manual for the working writer, with each ""gate"" exploring particular strategies of language and thought that allow a poem to convey meaning and emotion with clarity and force. Above all, Nine Gates is an insightful guide to the way the mind of poetry awakens our fundamental consciousness of what can be known when a person is most fully alive.  Read more Read less"

"title : The Melancholic Gaze - author : Piotr Sniedziewskicategory : poetrydescription : This book consists of nine chapters devoted to representations of melancholia in 19th-century art and literature. A noteworthy feature of the book is its use of concepts from later works by Sigmund Freud, Jean Clair, Jean Starobinski, Julia Kristeva and others. Those concepts elucidate further contexts of the notion of melancholia, which are presented not in isolation but juxtaposed with the philosophical background of the concept (starting from Hippocrates and Aristotle). Thus, the book not only provides a survey of images and modes of behaviour of 19th-century individuals, but also discusses the meanings of melancholia as they appeared in European culture over time.

"title : Mission Work - author : Aaron Bakercategory : poetrydescription : In this prize-winning collection, a debut poet evokes his childhood as the son of missionaries in Papua New Guinea.  Mission Work is an arresting collection of poems based on Aaron Baker’s experiences as a child of missionaries living among the Kuman people in the remote Chimbu Highlands of Papua New Guinea. Rich with Christian and Kuman myths and stories, the poems explore Western and tribal ways of looking at the world -- an interface of vastly different cultures and notions of spirituality, illuminated by the poet’s own struggles as he comes of age in this unique environment.  The images conjured in Mission Work are viscerally stirring: native people slaughter pigs for a Chimbu wedding ceremony; a papery flight of cicadas cuts through a cloud forest; hands sting as they beat a drum made of dried snakeskin. Quieter moments are shot through with the unfamiliar as well. In “Bird of Paradise,” a father angles his son’s head toward the canopy of the jungle so the boy can catch sight of an elusive bird.

"title : Lovely Legs - author : Jean O'Briencategory : poetrydescription : A lively, readable collection concerned with the intricacies of relationships and the many moral contradictions of society,..they are all very clearly in O'Brien's voice, a seemingly carefree lilt which nonetheless exudes complexity and depth....Similarly, the many poems here addressed to or about O'Brien's 'younger self' attempt to civilise the unruliness of childhood, and, in a self-mythologising turn, lessons are always learnt. Often they are comically disproportionate to the experience, such as when O'Brien recalls how, as children travelling along redbrick lanes, she and her friends were approached by a pervert, a Joycean encounter which'made us remeber/to hurry home for 'tea.

"title : Ten Poems to Change Your Life Again and Again - author : Roger Housdencategory : poetrydescription : Every great poem invites us to step beyond what we know, what we think we can dream or dare. Great poetry is a catalyst for change: a change of mind, a change of heart, a change of life- and yes, over and over, again and again, with each new reading, and each new phase of our journey.That's why poetry is dangerous. It gives voice to our unspoken dreams; it is a mirror to our own deepest joys, desires, and sorrows. It can tip us over into a new life, into a new way of seeing and being, that a moment ago we might even have had no words for.In this new volume of his Ten Poems series, Roger Housden takes ten great poems and in personal, intimate essays shows how they led him, and can also lead us, into a more deeply lived and examined life. Housden says, ""Every one of the poems in this book has struck me a blow, a direct hit, each of them, into the heart of hearts. Every one of them, in its own way, has opened a door for me to go deeper into my own experience, my own longings, my own sorrows and joys, and into the silence that surrounds all of this, all of us, always.""From the Hardcover edition.

"title : Faithful and virtuous night - author : Louise Glückcategory : poetrydescription : Louise Gluck is one of the finest American poets at work today. Her Poems 1962-2012 was hailed as ""a major event in this country's literature"" in the pages of The New York Times. Every new collection is at once a deepening and a revelation. Faithful and Virtuous Night is no exception. You enter the world of this spellbinding book through one of its many dreamlike portals, and each time you enter it's the same place but it has been arranged differently. You were a woman. You were a man. This is a story of adventure, an encounter with the unknown, a knight's undaunted journey into the kingdom of death; this is a story of the world you've always known, that first primer where ""on page three a dog appeared, on page five a ball"" and every familiar facet has been made to shimmer like the contours of a dream, ""the dog float[ing] into the sky to join the ball."" Faithful and Virtuous Night tells a single story but the parts are mutable, the great sweep of its narrative mysterious and fateful, heartbreaking and charged with wonder.   Read more Read less"

"title : Nature's Paintbox - author : Patricia Thomascategory : poetrydescription : How would you capture winter’s crispness, spring’s softness, summer’s freshness, and autumn’s richness? In this inspiring title, poet Patricia Thomas imagines each season rendered in a different art medium. Pen and ink, with spots of color, capture winter’s mood, while pastel chalks make spring flowers bloom into life. The see-through hues of watercolors celebrate summer’s warmth, while vibrant oils perfectly paint fall’s majestic scenes. Artist Craig Orback takes up the poem’s challenge in his marvelous illustrations, using each of the mediums described. Just as the seasons move seamlessly into one another, so too do the art styles blend together, then emerge in full splendor, and blend again as the next season approaches.   Read more Read less"

"title : New European poets - author : Wayne Millercategory : poetrydescription : A major anthology spanning the diversity of the latest poetry to come out of Europe  New European Poets presents the works of poets from across Europe. In compiling this landmark anthology, Wayne Miller and Kevin Prufer enlisted twenty-four regional editors to select 270 poets whose writing was first published after 1970. These poets represent every country in Europe, and many of them are published here for the first time in English and in the United States. The resulting anthology collects some of the very best work of a new generation of poets who have come of age since Paul Celan, Anna Akhmatova, Federico García Lorca, Eugenio Montale, and Czeslaw Milosz.  The poetry in New European Poets is fiercely intelligent, often irreverent, and engaged with history and politics. The range of styles is exhilarating―from the lyric intimacy of Portuguese poet Rosa Alice Branco to the profane prose poems of Romanian poet Radu Andriescu, from the surrealist bravado of Czech poet Sylva Fischerová to the survivor's cry of Russian poet Irina Ratushinskaya. Poetry translated from more than thirty languages is represented, including French, German, Spanish, and Italian, and more regional languages such as Basque, Irish Gaelic, and Sámi.  In its scope and ambition, New European Poets is destined to be a seminal anthology, an important vehicle for American readers to discover the extraordinary poetry being written across the Atlantic.

"title : AN AMERICAN PAPYRUS - author : Steven David Justin Sillscategory : poetrydescription : Papyrus: An Eloquent Ode to Life's Many Gritty Moments    by Amy L. Wilson    Arkansas Gazette    Little Rock, Arkansas    April 1990  An American Papyrus    Steven Sills    The Chestnut Hills Press Poetry Series    63 pages; $6.95 paperback  Twenty-six poems make up this first published book by Steven Sills, 26, of Fayetteville.  Sills' vision is often a dark one.  He writes of the homeless, the abused, the forgotten people.  He is also intrigued with the mystical, the sensual/sexual, loss--as in losing those whom we hold dear, such as a spouse or lover--as well as the lost, such as someone who is autistic, who seems unreachable.  Sills' skillful use of the language to impart the telling moments of a life is his strength.  He chooses his words carefully, employing a well-developed vocabulary.  He is thoughtful about punctuation, where to break lines and when to make a new stanza.  He's obviously well versed in ""great"" literature.  Sills' command of language helps to soften the blows of some of the seamier passages found in his poems.  Seamy may not be the best word to use.  Perhaps gritty is a better word or just plain matter-of-fact and to the point, as in this descriptive passage from ""Oracion A Traves De Gasshole,"" about the hopeless feelings of a respiratory therapy worker:  ""With the last of the air drawing in/ Begins to fold its walls; and he could imagine it/ Like he could imagine from inexact memories/ The woman last night at the hospital, whom he began to like---/ Her body pulling cell by cell/ Apart before he had a chance to finish the rescue with the hose.""  The book begins with ""Post-Annulment2"" a poem with a poignant description of society's displaced--""As the sun blazes upon the terminal's/ Scraped concrete/The shelved rows of the poor men""--and continues by describing a city scene through the eyes of a maintenance worker at the Hilton Hotel.  The protagonist's wife has left him and he is taking the bus to work that morning, his mind wandering as he looks for the key to why she is gone.  ""He rings the bell. / The idea of her not home and legally annulled/ From his life--her small crotch not tightened to his desperate thrusts/ Makes him feel sick.  He gets down from the bus./  He goes to work.  He suddenly knows that he is not in love.""  As many poets will do, Sills could not leave this work alone.  So a hybrid of this poem, ""Post-Annulment"" ends the book.  In it, he has kept many of the original lines and added parenthetical remarks to expand on his ideas.  It is in this context he allows himself to comment on religion:  ""Religion is a lie!  Everything is a lie!"" and on marriage:  ""Marriage, that sanctified legal rape, fosters the child-man to be a destined societal function as he grows up in the family unit.""  Not all of the poems are so bleak and cynical in every passage, however, as is apparent in ""The San Franciscan's Night Meditations"":  ""The night is full of impulses to live and run and seep heavily into its dark robes of silence and morbid rightness.""  People who do not feel comfortable examining in detail the darker side of life--the the details that the average person overlooks because it just hurts or feels to strange to look--will not enjoy this book.  Serious writers of free verse, contemporary poetry and/or those who study it will not be disappointed.  Sills, a native of Missouri, is a recent graduate of Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield.  He currently is working in Fayetteville.  Sills dedicated his book to Mike Burns, a poet and teacher at SMSU who helped him edit his work.   Read more Read less"

Life could become a summer afternoon, a slow swim in a warm lake. I could become another backyard roustabout, part of the greedy gang eying the vegetable garden. The larcenous woodchuck returns. We exchange a long gaze but he gives no clue of what to do next. The poems ponder various ways to adapt to unaccustomed leisure--napping, complaining, gardening, volunteering, and so on. Observing time's curious way of intermittently sprinting then lollygagging, and understanding more clearly every day that time doesn't exist anyway, the poet relishes moments, which are . . . liable to be caught like a leaf in the eddy of a brook, lodged only long enough to look, and which become her subjects. -- back cover.

"title : Something shining - author : Daniel Halperncategory : poetrydescription : Widely praised for his earlier collections, Daniel Halpern has grown steadily in stature and attainment. Now, with Something Shining, his first collection of new poems in seven years, he gives us an ambitious, wide-ranging meditation on birth, love, and maturity, marking a turning point in both his life and his work. These beautifully crafted poems explore relations between lovers, between friends, between fathers and children. Written by the light of a young daughter's presence, in the distinctive lyrical language that Ted Hughes described as ""so free and effortless and unerring,"" these poems ponder the fading of the body and the struggle that consciousness wages to keep the self afloat. And into this intimate world also enter a surprising array of characters: ancient Chinese poets and modern Cuban musicians, Charlie Parker, Chekhov, and the dervish mystic Rumi. But it is the poet's awareness of his own frailty (""the days run out--no longer oneself,"" he writes in ""Fugue""), that, together with the extraordinary beauty he discovers in environments familiar and exotic, unifies this collection. The work of a poet at the top of his form, Something Shining confirms Halpern's place in our national literature.From the Trade Paperback edition.   Read more Read less"

"title : My body - author : Joan Larkincategory : poetrydescription : Poetry.  ""Over the decades of writing, Joan Larkin has proved her mastery, whether the poem is mythic, elegiac, or biographical. Her honesty is overwhelming, but it is coupled with poetic cunning, gorgeous language and a rhythm and tone so precise and appropriate that it is--as in the great poets--transparent. There are no tricks and no evasive moves, nothing that in ten years she will be ashamed of or confused by. She is a poet of compassion and pity. Where it is appropriate, she is merciless, especially to herself. I love reading her poems; I love reading them over and over. I salute her""--Gerald Stern.   Read more Read less"
"title : Come sweet death - author : Bunyan Davie Napiercategory : poetrydescription : Napier was a Christian theologian of the first order.  Dean of Yale Divinity School at one point in his career.  This book is a poem cycle based in the stories of the book of Genesis in powerful language that describes the human truths that have described life on the planet since Genesis was written until now.  It's not pretty, it's not sugar coated, and parts of it would likely offend certain Christians who have their own, uninformed, ideas about what stories are actually in the Bible.

"title : Poems that make grown men cry - author : Anthony Holdencategory : poetrydescription : POETRY TEXTS & ANTHOLOGIES. GROWN MEN AREN'T SUPPOSED TO CRY. But in this fascinating anthology, one hundred men - distinguished in literature and film, science and architecture, theatre and human rights - confess to being moved to tears by poems that haunt them. Representing twenty nationalities and ranging in age from their early 20s to their late 80s, the majority are public figures not prone to crying. Here they admit to breaking down when ambushed by great art, often in words as powerful as the poems themselves. Seventy-five percent of the selected poems were written in the twentieth century, with more than a dozen by women. Their themes range from love in its many guises, through mortality and loss, to the beauty and variety of nature. Three men have suffered the pain of losing a child; others are moved to tears by the exquisite way a poet captures, in Alexander Pope's famous phrase, 'what oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd'.

"title : Todos os Gatos têm Sete Vidas - author : Ricardo Matosinhoscategory : catsdescription : Os gatos são animais aventureiros, caem sempre de pé e por isso são conhecidos em vários países europeus por terem sete vidas. Na tradição inglesa têm nove vidas e nas lendas árabes apenas seis. Nós humanos, só temos uma vida e não nos podemos dar ao luxo de a desperdiçar. Portanto nada melhor do que seguir os exemplos dos animais que têm mais “vidas” e aprender com eles.  O Tufa aprende a ter prudência, respeitar os animais, comer o que a natureza nos manda, não confiar em estranhos (mesmo que tenham boa aparência) e respeitar a diferença.  Nas suas aventuras é acompanhado pelo Aníbal, o pardal, seu fiel amigo que pede ajuda sempre que o vê em apuros. A ajuda surge quase sempre na figura do veterinário que é simultaneamente a voz da consciência e que ajuda o nosso herói a compreender as lições que deve retirar de cada aventura.

He was hit by a car when he was a little more than a year old and wound up with two functioning back legs- and that's it. One front leg was amputated, the other had a severed nerve and never functioned again. U. W. taught himself to propel himself around by ""rowing"" as put by his owner but could stand on his hind legs for minutes at a time and even jumped along kangaroo-style if hunting or chasing a trespasser out of his yard. He loved eating the rabbits he caught (cooked by his owners) and in later life developed a taste for fine wines, whisky and brandy (given only drops of course) If you love cats this is a great book, very touching, very funny and just a nice little book.

To the feline mind, these are the stuff of everyday life--as important as sleeping all day and grooming for several hours using nothing but your tongue.

Find out why cats knead against us, the best way to hold a cat, how cats can jump onto your kitchen counters without even a running start, why they chew on your sweaters.

"title : Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected [24 stories] - author : Roald Dahlcategory : catsdescription : A wine connoisseur with an infallible palate and a sinister taste in wagers. A decrepit old man with a masterpiece tattooed on his back. A voracious adventuress, a gentle cuckold, and a garden sculpture that becomes an instrument of sadistic vengeance. Social climbers who climb a bit too quickly. Philanderers whose deceptions are a trifle too ornate. Impeccable servants whose bland masks slip for one vertiginous instant.  In these deliciously nasty stories an internationally acclaimed practitioner of the short narrative works his own brand of black magic: tantalizing, amusing, and sometimes terrifying readers into a new sense of what lurks beneath the ordinary. Included in Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected are such notorious gems of the bizarre as ""The Sound Machine,"" ""Lamb to Slaughter,"" ""Neck,"" and ""The Landlady.""

"title : Corporation Man - author : Ant Jaycategory : catsdescription : The ultimate merging of The Naked Ape by Desmond Morris with The Manager's  handbook by Arthur Young and considerably more entertaining and informative than either. This has been my bible since I first laid hands on it around 1972. It is witty, observant, educative, entertaining and has the endearing charm of being one of those books you can open at any page or chapter and dive right in or skim. If there is any negative criticism I might lay at its pages, it would be a lack of cross-indexing. But this being the 21st Century, I'm sure there is an electronic version with a word search. A tiny quote from the chapter entitled ""When is a Leader not a Leader"" illustrates perfectly why I love this book and why it has been my rock when I have been in a hard place:- ... the normal corporation interview [is] to me as 'about as scientific as a couple of dogs sniffing each other's arses'. That could ONLY be written by the man who later was to produce the extraordinary insight into British Politics and the Civil Service:- ""Yes Minister"" and ""Yes Prime Minister"".

When Quinn Rosetti found the lost, injured kit-ten, she didn't think twice about rushing it to the veterinarian. Quinn returned McLeish to his owner, the Elderly Mrs. Elvira Featherstone, and there was no mention of a reward. But months later, when the eccentric woman passed away, Quinn was called into her lawyer's office for a reading of the will.  Quinn couldn't believe her ears when she heard the terms of the will. Mrs. Featherstone had concocted a crafty plan that relied on Quinn's sense of fairness and responsibility. If Quinn followed the plan, she would inherit enough money to care for her ailing father. But the thought of spending the next two months with Mrs. Featherstone's great-nephew, Gabriel Hunter, was ludicrous!  It didn't help that tall, dark, sexy Gabe had inherited his great-aunt's outrageous sense of humor. Before Quinn knew what had hit her, the fiery redhead was spinning with thoughts of Gabe Hunter. She was supposed to be sharing custody of McLeish with Gabe. Instead, she found herself sharing her thoughts, her deepest secrets, and kisses sweeter than spring blossoms. Gabe Hunter captivated Quinn as he moved into her life--and her cabin. Quin couldn't resist him... though she was sure this was not what old Mrs. Featherstone had in mind!   Read more Read less"

"title : Call of the cats - author : Andrew Bloomfieldcategory : catsdescription : When Andrew Bloomfield moved into a modest bungalow in Southern California he was only vaguely aware that a colony of feral cats inhabited the deep foliage behind his new home. After one particularly poignant experience, he felt he had no choice but to intercede. So began the saga of Andrew's dramatic relationship with this group of skittish, wild, and sometimes fierce felines. He began to name, nurse, feed, house, rescue, and neuter them. He rose from his bed in the middle of countless nights to fend off their attackers and maxed out credit cards paying vet bills and emergency room hospital visits when he was mauled by the very cats he was trying to help. Call of the Cats is a heartwarming tale of one man's journey from self-absorption to selflessness that is sure to appeal not only to cat lovers but to pet owners the world over. It is also an exploration of the world we live in but rarely see, how our lives overlap with the lives of other creatures, and how such things as names and sibling relationships cross species and continents. Andrew learned that spiritual lessons surround us, no matter where we are and what we do, if we simply stop and learn. He also discovered the joy and satisfaction in helping even one living being to a better life and the solace that comes from another living being, no matter what the circumstances.

"title : Poes - author : Sandrin Coorevitscategory : catsdescription : This richly illustrated book highlights the unique relationship between humans and cats. Cats are more popular than ever today, but where does that fascination come from? What role did cats play in earlier societies? Recent research shows that about 10,000 years ago, cats chose to commit themselves to humans. Egyptian culture is the first to depict cats on a large scale. But cats are also discussed in other religions: the prophet Mohammed is said to have had a special bond with his cat, and in the Middle Ages there was a 'cat monastery' in Cyprus, where monks took care of cats. From the twelfth century, cats in Europe were increasingly associated with the devil and witchcraft. The devil sometimes appeared in the form of a cat, and sometimes witches transformed themselves into cats to play 'mischief'. That bad reputation would carry the cat for centuries to come. The special link between women and cats, the often bawdy double meanings in works of art and the dual meaning of the word '(playing) cat' are also extensively discussed. Recent scientific insights enter into a dialogue with historical and contemporary art and photography in a playful, visual way. Nine chapters and over 200 photographs and reproductions from numerous international collections provide a look at the cat as a pet, god, devil, wife, muse and friend over time and across cultures. Exhibition: Yper Museum, Ypres, Belgium (01.05.2021-30.01.2022)  Dit rijk geïllustreerde boek zet de unieke relatie tussen mens en kat in de kijker. Katten zijn vandaag populairder dan ooit, maar waar komt die fascinatie vandaan? Welke rol speelden poezen in vroegere samenlevingen? Uit recent onderzoek blijkt dat de kat er zo'n 10.000 jaar geleden zelf voor heeft gekozen om zich aan de mens te binden. De Egyptische cultuur is de eerste die op grote schaal katten afbeeldt. Maar ook in andere religies komen katten aan bod: de profeet Mohammed had naar verluidt een speciale band met zijn kat en op Cyprus was er in de middeleeuwen een 'kattenklooster', waar monniken voor katten zorgden. Vanaf de twaalfde eeuw werden katten in Europa steeds meer geassocieerd met de duivel en hekserij. De duivel verscheen soms in de vorm van een kat en soms transformeerden heksen zelf in katten om 'kattenkwaad' uit te halen. Die slechte reputatie zou de kat nog eeuwenlang meedragen. Ook de bijzondere link tussen vrouwen en katten, de vaak schunnige dubbele bodems in kunstwerken en de tweeledige betekenis van het woord '(stoei)poes' worden uitgebreid belicht. Op een speelse, visuele manier gaan recente wetenschappelijke inzichten in dialoog met historische en hedendaagse kunst en fotografie. Negen hoofdstukken en meer dan 200 foto's en reproducties uit tal van internationale collecties bieden een blik op de kat als huisdier, god, duivel, vrouw, muze en vriend in de loop der tijden en in verschillende culturen.

At a time when many of her friends are thinking about retiring Bridie finds herself trying to convince Walmart that they need a Playwright-in-Residence.

One of her cats needs expensive allergy shots from the vet "" ... the cat creeps in on little fog feet the little frigger, cats are the original false advertising ..."" and the normally docile neighborhood is suddenly very popular with the local hookers.

"title : Leaving the wild - author : Gavin Ehringercategory : catsdescription : ""The domestication of animals changed the course of human history. But what about the animals who abandoned their wild existence in exchange for our care and protection? Domestication has proven to be a wildly successful survival strategy. But this success has not been without its drawbacks. A modern dairy cow's daily energy output equals that of a Tour de France rider. Feral cats overpopulate urban areas. And our methods of breeding horses and dogs have resulted in debilitating and sometimes lethal genetic diseases. But these problems and more can be addressed, if we have the will and the compassion. Human values and choices determine an animal's lot in life even before he or she is born. Just as a sculptor's hands shape clay, so human values shape our animal's for good and or ill. The little-examined, yet omnipresent act of breeding lies at the core of Gavin Ehringer's eye-opening book. You'll meet cows cloned from steaks, a Quarter horse stallion valued at $7.5 million, Chinese dogs that glow in the dark, and visit a Denver cat show featuring naked cats and other cuddly mutants. Is this what the animals bargained for all those millennia ago, when they first joined us by the fire?""--Amazon.com.   Read more Read less"

"title : The Cat and the Human Imagination - author : Billy Mortoncategory : catsdescription : The Cat and the Human Imagination is a fascinating historical survey of the changing cultural attitudes towards cats and the myriad ways that they have been depicted in literature and art. Feline images have permeated civilization since the time of the ancient Egyptians, and during this time the status of the cat has changed dramatically. The book examines the changing images-- fertility goddess, sly little predator, agent of Satan, avenging witness, aristocrat, friend, spirit of the home, bloodthirsty killer, seductive female--and relates them to the contexts in which they arose. It also analyzes how human attitudes towards cats seem to have evolved in parallel with attitudes towards animals, towards authority, and towards gender. Western literature and visual art have reflected this change, developing from bare sketches to richly varied expressions of feline personality and human interaction with cats. Katharine M. Rogers seeks out the cats who make appearances in an impressive range of literary and artistic works, providing the first critical look at the symbolic functioning of cat characters in Poe's ""The Black Cat,"" Dickens's Bleak House, and Zola's Therese Raquin, among other literary works. The historical and artistic range covered is impressive, creating a rich compendium that is the ideal book for the cat lover seeking a refreshingly substantial and scholarly work about this fascinating animal. - Publisher.

Chincategory : chemistrydescription : FOCUSING ON CONTAMINANT FATE AND TRANSPORT, DESIGN OF ENVIRONMENTAL-CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS    This textbook details the fundamental equations that describe the fate and transport of contaminantsin the water environment. The application of these fundamental equations to the design of environmental-control systems and methodologies for assessing the impact of contaminant discharges into rivers, lakes, wetlands, ground water, and oceans are all covered. Readers learn to assess how much waste can be safely assimilatedinto a water body by developing a solid understanding of the relationship between the type of pollutant discharged, the characteristics of the receiving water, and physical, chemical, and biological impacts. In cases of surface runoff from urban and agricultural watersheds, quantitative relationships between the quality of surface runoff and the characteristics of contaminant sources located within the watersheds are presented.    Some of the text's distinguishing features include its emphasis on the engineering design of systems that control the fate and transport of contaminants in the water environment, the design of remediation systems, and regulatory constraints. Particular attention is given to use-attainability analyses and the estimation of total maximum daily loads, both of which are essential components of water-quality control in natural systems. Readers are provided with a thorough explanation of the complex set of laws and regulations governing water-quality control in the United States.    Proven as an effective textbook in several offerings of the author's class ""Water Quality Control in Natural Systems,"" the flow of the text is carefully structured to facilitate learning. Moreover, a number of practical pedagogical tools are offered:   Practical examples used throughout the text illustrate the effects of controlling the quality, quantity, timing, and distribution of contaminant discharges into the environment   End-of-chapter problems, and an accompanying solutions manual, help readers assess their grasp of each topic as they progress through the text   Several appendices with useful reference material are provided, including current U.S. Water Quality Standards   Detailed bibliography guides readers to additional resources to explore particular topics in greater depth    With its emphasis on contaminant fate and transport and design of environmental-control systems, this text is ideal for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students in environmental and civil engineering programs.Environmental scientists and practicing environmental/civil engineers will also find the text relevant and useful.

"title : Computational inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry - author : Edward I. Solomoncategory : chemistrydescription : ""Over the past several decades there have been major advances in our ability to evaluate computationally the electronic structure of inorganic molecules, particularly transition metal systems. This advancement is due to the Moore's Law increase in computing power as well as the impact of density functional theory (DFT) and its implementation in commercial and freeware programs for quantum chemical calculations. Improved pure and hybrid density functionals are allowing DFT calculations with accuracy comparable to high-level Hartree-Fock treatments, and the results of these calculations can now be evaluated based on experiment.      When calculations are correlated to and supported by experimental data they can provide fundamental insight into electronic structure and its contributions to physical properties and chemical reactivity. This interplay continues to expand and contributes to both improved value of experimental results and improved accuracy of computational predictions.      The purpose of this EIC Book is to provide state-of-the-art presentations of quantum mechanical and related methods and their applications by many of the leaders in the field. Part One of this volume focuses on methods, their background and implementation, and their use in describing bonding properties, energies, transition states and spectroscopic features. Part Two focuses on applications in bioinorganic chemistry and Part Three discusses inorganic chemistry, where electronic structure calculations have already had a major impact. This addition to the EIC Book series is of significant value to both experimentalists and theoreticians, and we anticipate that it will stimulate both further development of the methodology and its applications in the many interdisciplinary fields that comprise modern inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry.

"title : Toxic Chemicals - author : Thomas E. Higginscategory : chemistrydescription : Catastrophic events such as the Bhopal, India tragedy and rising incidences of cancer in areas neighboring industrial facilities have heightened concern over the use of toxic chemicals in manufacturing and industry, particularly with respect to long-term exposure. While legislation and publicity have reduced the use of some chemicals, risks remain that continue to threaten the health of individuals worldwide. Based on the authors’ research conducted through their development of a program in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Toxic Chemicals: Risk Prevention Through Use Reduction examines various toxicity factors and proposes a plan to reduce the toxic impact of these hazardous substances. Explores all factors that contribute to toxicity The book begins by exploring the history of toxic chemical release reporting programs, a trend growing out of the Bhopal tragedy. It surveys their impact both in the United States through the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program and in the 29 other countries that maintain similar programs. Then, with the goal of developing a rational method of prioritizing toxic chemicals for reduction, the authors discuss mobility, persistence, and bioconcentration adjustment factors and present a method for integrating all of these factors to estimate the relative impact of chemical release. Compares alternate emphases in existing programs The book describes programs that concentrate on reducing the release of chemicals with the greatest adverse toxic impact and those that require companies to prepare pollution prevention plans and set goals for reducing use or release. It also examines technical assistance programs that help companies search for alternative chemicals to use or process changes that eliminate the use of toxic chemicals. In addition, it explores alternative market-based approaches for achieving environmental protection. Presents a workable plan for the future In the final chapters, the authors lay out their proposed program for reducing the use of toxic chemicals. This plan builds on the existing TRI program and uses lessons learned from this and other programs. The combined research assembled by the authors and their multifaceted approach to the issue of chemical toxicity enables companies and policy makers to move to the next level of toxic chemical use reduction, resulting in a safer environment for future generations.

"title : Digital Simulation in Electrochemistry - author : Dieter Britzcategory : chemistrydescription : This book deals in a simple manner with the numerical solution of parabolic partial differential (diffusion) equations as they appear in electroanalytical chemistry, but extends also to the more sophisticated and efficient techniques. Only a basic familiarity with mathematics is assumed. It is intended both as an elementary text for the beginner as well as a reference for the more experienced. It incorporates the newer methods such as orthogonal collocation, unequal intervals, hopscotch, Runge-Kutta integration of semidiscretised systems of equations, and implicit boundary value calculation, which is required for the Crank-Nicolson technique to be effective in this field, where derivative boundary conditions are the rule. This second edition has been updated extensively to take into account recent developments in the area. It also deals squarely with the problems resulting from homogenous chemical reactions. With the help of this book and its many programming examples, any electrochemist should be able to learn to use the technique quickly in its simpler forms and will hopefully be stimulated to learn about the more difficult methods later.

It also helps readers develop skills for operating, optimizing, and innovating particle processing technologies and machinery in order to carry out industrial operations, such as centrifugation, filtration, and membrane separations""--Provided by publisher.  ""Preface The idea of writing this book was conceived many years ago when the author started teaching unit operations in the undergraduate program of chemical engineering at the Autonomous University of Chihuahua, even prior to attend the, then, Postgraduate School of Studies in Powder Technology at the University of Bradford. The importance, relevance and prevailing of the topic of Particle Technology remain up to date. Studies by the Rand Corporation in the 1980s identified substantial differences in the scale-up and start-up performance of plants processing powders versus those processing liquids or gases. Particularly, in 1985, the Rand Report surveyed 40 US plants and found out that start-up times were 200-300% of those predicted (compared to 20% for fluid based plants) and only achieved approximately 50% of their designed throughput. By comparison, most fluid-based processes reached 90% of planned output over the same period. Some of the reasons described on the time of the report were related to an inadequate understanding of the behavior of particle systems, which is sensitive to process scale or process history in ways that would not be expected by engineers familiar only with liquid or gas systems. The response to overcome these difficulties came in the way of promoting research, programs of study, and other activities in the field of powder or particle technology worldwide. Substantial advancements have been achieved through all these initiatives but, apparently, many of the reported reasons for these unequal understanding of powder-based processes, as compared to fluid-based processes, remain up to these days. This perception can be implied by a current need of consultancy in the subject by different types of industries worldwide""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less"

"title : Computational materials science - author : June Gunn Leecategory : chemistrydescription : ""Preface No longer underestimated, computational science has emerged as a powerful partner to experimental and theoretical studies. Accelerated by the ever-growing power of computers and new computational methods, it is one of the fastest growing fields in science these days. Its predictive power in atomic and subatomic scales benefits all disciplines of science, and materials science is definitely one of them. Note that, for example, materials under extreme conditions such as high temperature or pressure, high radiation, on a very small scale, can be rather easily examined via the keyboard in computational materials science. Computational science has been a familiar subject in physics and chemistry, but in the materials field it was considered of secondary importance. It is now in the mainstream, and we have to catch up with the knowledge accumulated in the subject, which strongly involves physics and mathematics. Here, we are forced to deal with an obvious question: how much catch-up will be enough to cover the major topics and to perform computational works as materials researchers? Dealing with the entire field might be most desirable, but many certainly prefer to cover only the essential and necessary parts and would rather be involved in actual computational works. That is what this book is all about. As listed in the Further Readings sections in several chapters, a number of excellent and successful books are already available in this field. However, they are largely physics- or chemistry-oriented, full of theories, algorisms, and equations.

"title : Marie Curie - author : Susan Quinncategory : chemistrydescription : In this stunning and richly textured new biography, Susan Quinn presents us with a far more complicated picture of the woman we thought we knew. Drawing on family documents, Quinn sheds new light on the tragic losses and patriotic passion that infused Marie Sklodowska Curie's early years in Poland. And through access to Marie Curie's journal, closed to researchers until 1990, we hear in her own words of the intimacy and joy of her marriage to Pierre Curie and the depth of her despair at his premature death. The image of Marie Curie as the grieving widow, attired always in black, is familiar to many of us. Much less well known is the affair with a married colleague that helped her recover from her loss. The testimonials of friends, hitherto unavailable, lend this love story a sometimes painful immediacy. Marie Curie's public triumphs are well known: she was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and one of the few people, to date, to receive a second. Unknown or barely known are the defeats she suffered: her rejection by the French Academy and her public humiliation at the hands of the French press over her love affair. As a scientist, Marie Curie has always been associated with the discovery of radium and polonium. But in fact more important than her work in isolating new elements was her idea that radioactivity was ""an atomic process."" Susan Quinn's biography provides a closer look at Marie Curie's work, and at the discoveries that led up to it and flowed from it. We come away understanding that Marie Curie was important but not singular: one of a small group of brilliant scientists whose combined efforts brought us to our current understanding of the material universe.

Performance and product quality are described in terms of specification requirements, and tools and techniques for the optimization of quality performance are provided. Figures and graphs are included within the reference to illustrate concepts""--  ""This book is written from a perspective that was developed as the result of 37 years of industrial research at The Dow Chemical Company that focused on inventing, developing and implementing industrial separation and purification processes. The work process for research and development is the scientific method as follows: The Scientific Method 1) Define the problem and the opportunity. 2) Search and understand the state-of-the-art. 3) Develop a hypothesis, i.e. a concept or a model. 4) Design and run experiments to test the validity of the hypothesis. 5) Evaluate, summarize and document the results. The main problem in distillation process control is to separate and purify chemical components in liquid and vapor streams while shedding the disturbances that are imposed on the distillation column. The opportunity is to separate the components from a feed stream into new vapor and liquid streams that have increased economic value at a cost that is competitive with other producers.

"title : BioMEMS - author : Simona Badilescucategory : chemistrydescription : ""As technological advancements widen the scope of applications for biomicroelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS or biomicrosystems), the field continues to have an impact on many aspects of life science operations and functionalities. Because BioMEMS research and development require the input of experts who use different technical languages and come from varying disciplines and backgrounds, scientists and students can avoid potential difficulties in communication and understanding only if they possess a skill set and understanding that enables them to work at the interface of engineering and biosciences.Keeping this duality in mind throughout, BioMEMS: Science and Engineering Perspectives supports and expedites the multidisciplinary learning involved in the development of biomicrosystems. Divided into nine chapters, it starts with a balanced introduction of biological, engineering, application, and commercialization aspects of the field. With a focus on molecules of biological interest, the book explores the building blocks of cells and viruses, as well as molecules that form the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), linkers, and hydrogels used for making different surfaces biocompatible through functionalization. The book also discusses: Different materials and platforms used to develop biomicrosystems Various biological entities and pathogens (in ascending order of complexity) The multidisciplinary aspects of engineering bioactive surfaces Engineering perspectives, including methods of manufacturing bioactive surfaces and devices Microfluidics modeling and experimentation Device level implementation of BioMEMS concepts for different applications. Because BioMEMS is an application-driven field, the book also highlights the concepts of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) and micro total analysis system (ơTAS), along with their pertinence to the emerging point-of-care (POC) and point-of-need (PON) applications""--Provided by publisher.  ""Preface We are proud to present this book as an attempt to bridge different areas that constitute the field of biomicroelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS), often called biomicrosystems. The field of BioMEMS has been growing rapidly since the early 1990s due to the advancements in microtechnologies that could cater to the vast application requirements of bio areas. The potential of BioMEMS suits this technology for many applications, including clinical and environmental diagnostics, drug delivery, agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, chemical synthesis, etc. It is foreseen that BioMEMS will have a deep impact on many aspects of the life science operations and functionalities in the near future. Scientists and students that work in the field of BioMEMS will need to have knowledge and skills at the interface between engineering and biosciences. Development of a BioMEMS device usually involves many scientists and students from various disciplines, such as biosciences, medicine, biochemistry, engineering, physics, etc. One could anticipate many communication and understanding issues that would arise among these people with varied expertise and training. The methods, details, and languages of training are quite different for the students and researchers of engineering and biosciences. As a result, researchers and students involved with multidisciplinary projects like BioMEMS undergo an interesting and refreshing learning on multidisciplinary subjects along the project development. This book aims to support and expedite the multidisciplinary learning involved with the development of biomicrosystems, from both bioscience and engineering perspectives""--Provided by publisher.

"title : Quantum Mechanics - author : Franz Schwablcategory : chemistrydescription : A student's first course on quantum mechanics provides the foundation essential for much of his or her future work in physics, be it in atomic, elementary particle, or solid state physics. This introductory textbook contains not only the foundations and many applications of quantum mechanics, but also new aspects and their experimental verification. It has as its particular virtues clarity and conciseness of presentation, while at the same time being self-contained. Comprehensibility is further guaranteed by the inclusion of all the mathematical steps required for a complete understanding. Carefully chosen problems help to consolidate the student's knowledge. In the introductory chapters, starting from the historical evolution of the subject, the fundamental postulates are developed inductively by means of an interference experiment. Thereafter the structure is purely deductive, covering all of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, plus the quantization of the radiation field in the context of optical transitions. As well as the quantum mechanical ""essentials"", for instance, detailed treatments of scattering theory, time dependent phenomena, and the density matrix, such topics as the theory of quantum mechanical measurement and the Bell inequality are dis- cussed. A separate chapter is devoted to supersymmetric quantum mechanics, an area which to date has been accessible only in the research literature.   Read more Read less"

"title : Physicochemical hydrodynamics - author : Ronald F. Probsteincategory : chemistrydescription : Since the first publication of the book, a surge of interest in physicochemical hydrodynamics (PCH) has produced a flurry of advances in the field, as researchers became aware of the subject's practical applications across numerous disciplines. The Second Edition of Ronald F. Probstein's Physicochemical Hydrodynamics is significantly expanded and revised to provide increased coverage of the field. All of the material was supplemented with problems for students, and a solutions manual is available for instructors. The continued demand for the book necessitates that the Second Edition be reprinted in paperback so that it may be more widely available to students and practitioners.   This highly respected book emphasizes rational theory and its consequences to demonstrate the underlying unity of PCH, which allows diverse phenomena to be described in physically and mathematically similar ways. Physicochemical Hydrodynamics communicates the fundamentals while, at the same time, conveying the importance of applications of PCH to a variety of fields, including: mechanical, chemical, and environmental engineering; materials science, biotechnology, microfluidics, and fluid aspects of nanotechnology. Numerous illustrations, analogies, and examples highlight the text and help to clarify and solidify students' and professionals' understanding of the material.   Read more Read less"

Born in 1797 to a silk-dyer, he helped his father's business as a pattern designer. His drawing talent from an early age attracted the attention of the famous print master Toyokuni Utagawa, and Kuniyoshi became one of his apprentices in 1811. The range of Kuniyoshi's preferred subjects included many genres: landscapes, beautiful women, Kabuki actors, mythical animals, and cats. More than any other Japanese artist, Kuniyoshi depicted cats humorously and satirically, with great accuracy and careful observation.

"title : A hiss before dying - author : Rita Mae Browncategory : catsdescription : ""Rita Mae Brown and her feline co-author Sneaky Pie Brown are back chasing mystery with their unique circle of Southern sleuths. And though the changing colors of fall are a beauty to behold, this year the scattered leaves hide a grim surprise. Autumn is in the air in the Blue Ridge Mountain community of Crozet, Virginia--and all the traditions of the changing seasons are under way. Mary Minor ""Harry"" Haristeen cleans her cupboards, her husband, Fair, prepares the horses for the shorter days ahead, and the clamorous barking of beagles signals the annual rabbit chase through the central Virginia hills. But the last thing the local beaglers and their hounds expect to flush out is a dead body. Disturbingly, it's the second corpse to turn up, after that of a missing truck driver too disfigured to identify. The deaths seem unrelated--until Harry picks up a trail of clues dating back to the state's post-Revolutionary past. The echoes of the Shot Heard Round the World pale in comparison to the dangerous shootout Harry narrowly escapes unscathed. Next time, it may be the killer who gets lucky. But not if Harry's furry friends Mrs. Murphy, Pewter, and Tucker can help it. Lending their sharp-nosed talents to the hunt, they'll help their mistress keep more lives from being lost--and right an injustice buried since the early days of America's independence.

Research has found that petting a cat can lower blood pressure and a cat's purr is thought to help heal body tissues and bones. But not just any cat can be a therapy cat, after all, such animals need to be friendly with strangers and willing to be touched, petted and held by unfamiliar people. They have to be tolerant ofloud voices and angry shouting, emotional distress, and sudden movements. It's a tall order for any animal,but a particular challenge for a cat.  In Purr Therapy, psychotherapist and cat lover Dr. Kathleen McCoy shows how two very special cats rose to this challenge, how they helped wounded souls to heal and how they taught even her lessons in mindfulness, joyful living, and compassion. She also shows readers how animal-assisted psychotherapy works and gives them an intimate and moving inside look at how Timmy and Marina worked with patients, how their double role as animal companions and cotherapists changed lives, and how, after their untimely deaths, the grief shared by those who knew and loved them led to even more growth and healing.  It's no surprise that there is a tidal wave of cat fanciers growing: even the internet prefers cats. No dog site has reached the proportions of the most popular cat sites--case in point: the mega-star Grumpy Cat who has over 2-million followers! More than an internet trend, this very active market is exploding through cat video contests and festivals that are claiming the passions of millions who will benefit from--and love--Purr Therapy""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Turtle soup - author : Kathleen Thompsoncategory : catsdescription : ""Who doesn't enjoy an easy read when nothing other than pure escapism is required? This cozy series has everything you seek: an eclectic cast of characters, a mystery or two, and diligent detectives on duty. Oh. Did I forget to mention the detectives are feline and canine? The series, Tiger Lily's Café, is set in a Midwestern town nestled into the coast of a Great Lake. The setting itself acts as a character, bringing the reader into the sights, sounds and smells of the small resort community of Chelsea. Read the series in order, or read any book alone. Each volume stands alone with a clear beginning and a clear end. Volume One of the series, Turtle Soup, introduces the reader to Annie, a woman whose ownership of a prime piece of real estate and several businesses was, well, almost a mistake. But own it, she does, and she makes the best of an idyllic situation. With her family of rescue cats and a diverse collection of business managers, staff and friends, Annie embraces her home on The Avenue, a picturesque slice of life that embodies the best--and sometimes the worst--that humanity has to offer. In Turtle Soup, Annie's Café is in trouble. Several issues have marred otherwise pristine reviews from the Health Department. Annie can't figure out what is happening or why. In the meantime, a not-so-very-good friend, Geraldine, has opened a diner that looks remarkably like the Café. Geraldine seems to benefit from Annie's problems. Annie is blind, but Tiger Lily, the oldest of Annie's cats, is wise to Geraldine’s deception. A group of guests arrive at Annie's bed and breakfast. They appear to be typical 'beautiful people.' They have pre-booked an extended fishing cruise on the lake but arrive early to spend a few days in town. Intrigue seems to follow them. The intrigue turns darker, and through the efforts of another of Annie's cats, Little Socks, the depth of their depravity is eventually made known to Annie and her friends. But is it too late? Tiger Lily and her siblings, along with their canine friends Jock and Cyril, are wise to the dangers lurking around Chelsea, but they can't seem to make their humans understand. The humans are in the soup. They just don't know it""--Amazon.com.   Read more Read less"

"title : On the Road with Suzy: From Cat to Companion - author : Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehmcategory : catsdescription : Summary:  On temporary assignment in Houston, Texas, at the start of 1998, Aleksandra and her husband Norman never expected that their lives would be changed forever when a small chocolate-gold-black stray cat stalked into the apartment complex where they were living, and adopted them.  Suzy soon became a key family member, and has traveled with the author to Delaware, Illinois, Wisconsin, both Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri, often on visits to Native American reservations. A frequent flyer, Suzy has also journeyed to Poland nine times, often in the company of Claude, another adopted stray. During these travels, Suzy, sociable and popular, introduced her owners to many new experiences and a range of new friends and acquaintances; not just other cats and humans, but also dogs, opossums, and armadillos.  In a life full of animals, Suzy’s owners have had to confront many of the dilemmas that cat ownership brings; from the difficulties of identifying responsible homes for a litter of kittens to the pain of handling an animal’s death. They have also found many surprising moments of joy, especially in observing the lives and interactions of the many stray cats that share our neighborhoods.  This is the story of a deepening relationship between a couple and their cat, written by an award-winning author, and filled with insightful comments about cat behavior and the nature of the human-feline bond. The episodes in this book will delight and inform other “cat people” and will leave readers with a new understanding of the way interactions with animals transform our lives.  COMMENTS  AND  REVIEWS  “I am a cat lover as well as a friend and admirer of Dr.Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm other fine publications and books.         I am sure that all animal lovers will find it truly wonderful, and all thinking people, even if they hate cats, will find it a profound, sensitive, insightful and funny book.        Dr. Aleksandra's understanding of cats, and animals in general, goes beyond our common need for the unconditional love we receive from our pets. It reaches into our deepest feelings and spiritual needs in line with the Taoist and Buddhist philosophy of wisdom and compassion: that the belief in an absolute unity transcends all divergencies, and all life is seen to be but forms of the Primal One.”    Audrey Ronning Topping  “Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boem should be highly commended for writing a book that conveys so well the author’s appreciation and compassion for animals”    Robert Ackerman  “I have always liked cats admiring their grace, cleanliness and even their ""quirks"" that are interesting to say the least. The wonderful story about the very special cat Suzy gave me a new dimension of admiration for cats. Reciprocating with love, devotion and faithfulness is a cat's reward for that given to them by humans. The book by Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm is definitely a ""good read"".     Carl Boehm    .    “I always like dogs and whole my life I had a one around me. Cats - in my opinion - were too self absorbed and aloof. After reading ""On the Road with Suzy: From Cat to Companion"" I decided to have a cat. Now, just one month later, I am in love with him and became a great admirer of all cats. My cat is very independent in a way that I respect him, but he is so loving and giving that I love him. Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm did a miracle with me, and I am very thankful! “    Bill Smart     .  ""Many people would question Aleksandra's and her husband's decision to embark on a 2.5 months motor trip accompanied by their cat Suzy. Cats are generally considered not to enjoy automobile transportation. Then, we learn about thus special feline... calm, collected, warm, friendly; devoted and loving even under what must have been trying situations. Surely, Suzy has to be remarkable, unique and even brave to face challenges most cats never encounter. I can understand how she became a focal point and an integral member of the family. I wish Suzy many, many happy years.     What a beautiful book about the bond between a cat and humans!""     Mary Salkind, The Bond between a cat and humans, ALIBRIS, Sep. 10, 2010     .    “After reading ""On the Road with Suzy"" the first time, I was left with the feeling of why and how could I have always disliked cats as many others do. Surely, no one could dislike the sweet and loving Suzy. So, I reread Aleksandra's book and came to the conclusion that the love, caring and devotion she and her husband extended towards Suzy may have became a challenge to her. Her  qualities of affection and faithfulness were almost like those of a dog but tempered a bit by the normal aloofness and pride of a cat. However, when it was time to be affectionate, loving and faithful, Suzy responded. She is a remarkable feline and most interesting to read about!”    David Keller, GOOGLE BOOKS    .    “If Suzy could talk and probably does in cat language, I believe she would say to Aleksandra and Norman: ""I really love you for taking me in from stray status, for being with me during my pregnancy and birth on my five beautiful kittens, for striving to find good homes for my kittens because it was impossible to keep them, for always having time for me and tolerating my cat quirks and antics, for caring for me in sickness and in health, for always showing your love, affection and pride in me (and bragging about me too). You two are truly cat people, co we are a threesome""     This is a remarkable tale about a wonderful cat! “.   John Carr, ALIBRIS, September 2010  “Doctor Aleksandra is an animal lover. Her compassion for her cat, Suzy, makes this a book of discovery and adventure for all animal lovers.     Suzy found the Boehms, and stalking around their Houston apartment, won their hearts and soon became a member of the family. She accompanied them on trips either by auto or plane, a loving companion.    Aleksandra understood the need of compassion and love for animals, and they related to her. A description of a long cross-country trip with husband, Norman is hilarious, as they must make accommodations before and during the trip. Suzy survives and explores her new surroundings in Delaware. Later on Suzy even flies to Poland with her owners.     This is truly a couple who enjoy and deeply care for the welfare of their animals”.

Valdemar / Fall of the House of Usher / Gold Bug / Ms. Found in a Bottle / Pit and the Pendulum / Premature Burial / Tell-Tale Heart) - author : Edgar Allan Poecategory : catsdescription : The best of Edgar Allan Poe's stories hold a unique place in literature. Not oniy was he one of the few great masters of the difficult art of the short story ; he was also a truly astonishing originator of styles of fiction which have since developed and become important branches of literature.  The present collection contains his best tales of terror, and also of fantasy—and illustrates his amazing originality. Such classics as The Cask of Amontillado, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Fall of the House of Usher, The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar and The Pit and the Pendulum hardly need introduction. They are still among the most horrifying crawlers' (as Stevenson called them) in the language—and not even R.L.S. nor Conan Doyle nor M. R. ames have surpassed them.  The Gold Bug is specially interesting as a finger-post leading to the Treasure Island type of story—of hidden treasure and the deciphering of ingenious clues and codes. Young readers will find excitement and true entertainment in these brilliantly imagined stories. They are matchless of their kind.    --front flap   Read more Read less"

"title : Selected Tales - author : Edgar Allan Poecategory : catsdescription : Edited with an Introduction and Notes by David Van Leer  Since their first publication in the 1830s and 1840s, Edgar Allan Poe's extraordinary Gothic tales have established many of the conventions which still dominate the genre of horror and detective fiction.  As well as being highly enjoyable, Poe's tales are works of very real intellectual exploration. Using the Gothic to question the integrity of human existence, Poe is less interested in moral retribution than in exposing the misconceptions that make things seem 'mysterious' in the first place. Attentive to the historical and political dimensions of these very American tales, this new critical edition selects twenty-four tales and places the most popular — 'The Fall of the House of Usher', 'The Masque of the Red Death', 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue', and 'The Purloined Letter ' — alongside less well-known travel narratives, metaphysical essays, and political satires.  • INTRODUCTION • TEXTUAL NOTE • BIBLIOGRAPHY • CHRONOLOGY • EXPLANATORY NOTES    --back cover   Read more Read less"

"title : The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen: discovered by the late Earl of Carnarvon and Howard Carter - author : Carter, Howardcategory : archaeologydescription : November 4, 1922. For six seasons the legendary Valley of the Kings has yielded no secrets to Howard Carter and his archeological team: ""We had almost made up our minds that we were beaten,"" he writes, ""and were preparing to leave The Valley and try our luck elsewhere; and then — hardly had we set hoe to ground in our last despairing effort than we made a discovery that far exceeded our wildest dreams.""    Join Howard Carter in his fascinating odyssey toward the most dramatic archeological find of the century — the tomb of Tutankhamen. Written by Carter in 1923, only a year after the discovery, this book captures the overwhelming exhilaration of the find, the painstaking, step-by-step process of excavation, and the wonder of opening a treasure-filled inner chamber whose regal inhabitant had been dead for 3,000 years.    104 on-the-spot photographs chronicle the phases of the discovery and the scrupulous cataloging of the treasures. The opening chapters discuss the life of Tutankhamen and earlier archeological work in the Valley of the Kings. An appendix contains fully captioned photographs of the objects obtained from the tomb. A new preface by Jon Manchip White adds information on Carter's career, recent opinions on Tutankhamen's reign, and the importance of Carter's discovery to Egyptologists.    Millions have seen the stunning artifacts which came from the tomb — they are among the glories of the Cairo Museum, and have made triumphal tours to museums the world over. They are a testament to the enigmatic young king, and to the unwavering tenacity of the man who brought them to light as described in this remarkable narrative.   Read more Read less"

But few know that within its bowels rests a priceless pre-Columbian antiquity—a treasure that now holds the key to a puzzle that is costing people their lives. For Kurt Austin, the leader of a courageous National Underwater Marine Agency (NUMA) exploration team, the killing begins when he makes a daring rescue of a beautiful marine archaeologist. The target of a powerful Texas industrialist named Halcon, Nina Kirov was attacked off the coast of Morocco after her discovery of a carved stone head that may prove Christopher Columbus was not the first European to discover America.  Soon Kurt and Nina embark on a deadly mission to uncover Halcon's masterful plan—an insidious scheme that would have him carve out a new nation from the southwest United States and Mexico, and ride to power on a wave of death and destruction. With Austin's elite NUMA crew attacking the murderous conspiracy from different sides, an extraordinary truth emerges; that Columbus may have made a fifth, unknown voyage to America in search of a magnificent treasure. And that the silent, steel hull of the Andrea Doria not only holds the answer to what the explorer may have found—but the fate of the United States itself.   Read more Read less"

"title : Shadow Divers - author : Robert Kursoncategory : archaeologydescription : In the tradition of Jon Krakauer’s Into Thin Air and Sebastian Junger’s The Perfect Storm comes a true tale of riveting adventure in which two weekend scuba divers risk everything to solve a great historical mystery–and make history themselves.  For John Chatterton and Richie Kohler, deep wreck diving was more than a sport. Testing themselves against treacherous currents, braving depths that induced hallucinatory effects, navigating through wreckage as perilous as a minefield, they pushed themselves to their limits and beyond, brushing against death more than once in the rusting hulks of sunken ships.    But in the fall of 1991, not even these courageous divers were prepared for what they found 230 feet below the surface, in the frigid Atlantic waters sixty miles off the coast of New Jersey: a World War II German U-boat, its ruined interior a macabre wasteland of twisted metal, tangled wires, and human bones–all buried under decades of accumulated sediment.    No identifying marks were visible on the submarine or the few artifacts brought to the surface. No historian, expert, or government had a clue as to which U-boat the men had found. In fact, the official records all agreed that there simply could not be a sunken U-boat and crew at that location.  Over the next six years, an elite team of divers embarked on a quest to solve the mystery. Some of them would not live to see its end. Chatterton and Kohler, at first bitter rivals, would be drawn into a friendship that deepened to an almost mystical sense of brotherhood with each other and with the drowned U-boat sailors–former enemies of their country. As the men’s marriages frayed under the pressure of a shared obsession, their dives grew more daring, and each realized that he was hunting more than the identities of a lost U-boat and its nameless crew.  Author Robert Kurson’s account of this quest is at once thrilling and emotionally complex, and it is written with a vivid sense of what divers actually experience when they meet the dangers of the ocean’s underworld. The story of Shadow Divers often seems too amazing to be true, but it all happened, two hundred thirty feet down, in the deep blue sea.    (front flap)   Read more Read less"

"title : The invisible sex - author : J. M. Adovasiocategory : archaeologydescription : Shaped by cartoons and museum dioramas, our vision of Paleolithic times tends to feature fur-clad male hunters fearlessly attacking mammoths while timid women hover fearfully behind a boulder. In fact, recent research has shown that this vision bears little relation to reality.The field of archaeology has changed dramatically in the past two decades, as women have challenged their male colleagues' exclusive focus on hard artifacts such as spear points rather than tougher to find evidence of women's work. J. M. Adovasio and Olga Soffer are two of the world's leading experts on perishable artifacts such as basketry, cordage, and weaving. In The Invisible Sex, the authors present an exciting new look at prehistory, arguing that women invented all kinds of critical materials, including the clothing necessary for life in colder climates, the ropes used to make rafts that enabled long-distance travel by water, and nets used for communal hunting. Even more important, women played a central role in the development of language and social life—in short, in our becoming human. In this eye-opening book, a new story about women in prehistory emerges with provocative implications for our assumptions about gender today.   Read more Read less"

"title : Sphinx - author : Robin Cookcategory : archaeologydescription : From the back of the book ""Amid the awesome temple in Egypt's Valley of the Kings a fabulous Treasure is waiting to be discovered, a treasure worth dying- or killing - for.    This book contains a little bit of something for everyone. It's a little mystery, adventure and romance. Like the title says, this is not a typical Robin Cook medical thriller. I found the book to be extremely enjoyable. It was easy reading and fascinating. Erica Baron travels to Egypt to escape/get away from a romance that she isn't sure she wants and to fulfil her dream as an Egyptologist what could go wrong. During a visit to an antique shop Erica meets Abdul Hamdi the proprietor who shows her an authentic life size statue of Seti I. But what she didn't bargain for was seeing Hamdi murdered before her very eyes. This starts a trail of intrigue, romance, and danger as Erica decides to help do something about the black market trading of Egyptian antiquities.  As usual, Mr. Cook's characters are colorful and seem so true to life. He brings the story alive and sets the various scenes without wasting words on descriptions. The characters are few and you don't really know who is friend or foe.  Again, don't be fooled. If you're a fan of Mr. Cook and are looking for his usual medical thriller this isn't one. Don't leave it off of your reading list though. For you die hard Cook fans, this is one of his earlier works and may be hard to find. I this book and read it in one day at the beach.  Mr. Cook, this book shows that you definitely have the ability to venture into other areas of writing rather than just medical thrillers. I will be placing this book on my shelf alongside your other novels. You are a great author in my opinion and greatly enjoy your works.  I gave this book 4 stars because I felt it could have been a little more exciting and was just a little slow starting. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys mystery, romance and intrigue.  Other books I have read by this author include Fever, Brain, Outbreak to many others to list here.  Again don't leave this book off of your reading list.   Read more Read less"

He shows how some major bilateral negotiations highlight the tensions involved in forging a strong relationship, while extensive analysis of the machinery of diplomacy (the administrative, political and legal framework) indicates the depth of bilateral ties. Also covered are the close consultation and diplomatic dealings over the decades and the personal connections between leaders.  The Australia-Japan Political Alignment documents for the first time, the details of this close and important relationship making it a new and original contribution to studies of Australia's foreign relations and Japan's place in the post-war world.

"title : Nefertiti Lived Here - author : Mary Chubbcategory : archaeologydescription : In 1930 Mary Chubb joined an expedition led by archaeologist John Pendlebury to the site of Tell el-Amarna, the remains of Akhetaten, the ephemeral capital founded by the heretical pharaoh Akhenaten (husband of Nefertiti, father of Tutankhamun). There, in addition to the administrative tasks that were initially assigned to her, she had to act as a ""plasterer, chemist, nurse, draftsman, painter, archaeologist, restorer, carpenter and, above all, diplomat!"". Nefertiti Lived Here (1954) is her retelling of ""her share of dust and heat,"" her love of her work, and her romantic evocations of historical events, which seem to play out before her. It is also the exceptional chronicle of daily life in a British archaeological camp in the 1930s.   Read more Read less"

"title : The Cave of John the Baptist - author : Shimon Gibsoncategory : archaeologydescription : The first archaeological evidence of the historical reality of the Gospel story.From a historical point of view, the uniqueness of this cave is that it contains archaeological evidence that comes to us from the very time of the personalities and events described in the Gospels. For here is the largest ritual bathing pool ever found in the Jerusalem area, and found in the village where John the Baptist was born, showing unmistakable signs of ritual use in the first century AD. Also in the cave is the earliest ever Christian art, depicting John the Baptist as well as the three crosses of the crucifixion.By using the forensic techniques available to the modern archaeologist, Gibson and his international team have been able to draw information from the drawings, pottery, coins, bones, remains of ritual fire and pieces of cloth found in the cave and match these up with the contemporary literary sources. This is a unique opportunity to build up a picture of the very first Christians, how they lived and even what they believed. As Gibson writes: ""By fitting together the new archaeological facts with the historical information available (and sometimes buried) in scholarly literature, I believe I am able to throw an amazing amount of light on the personality and mission of John the Baptist. Who was he? Where did he come from? What were his beliefs and what was the baptism all about?""From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less"
"title : Archaeology of the Spanish Civil War - author : Alfredo González Ruibalcategory : archaeologydescription : The Archaeology of the Spanish Civil War offers the first comprehensive account of the Spanish Civil War from an archaeological perspective, providing an alternative narrative on one of the most important conflicts of the twentieth century, widely seen as a prelude to the Second World War.  Between 1936 and 1939, totalitarianism and democracy, fascism and revolution clashed in Spain, while the latest military technologies were being tested, including strategic bombing and combined arms warfare, and violence against civilians became widespread. Archaeology, however, complicates the picture as it brings forgotten actors into play: obsolete weapons, vernacular architecture, ancient structures (from Iron Age hillforts to sheepfolds), peasant traditions, and makeshift arms. By looking at these things, another story of the war unfolds, one that pays more attention to intimate experiences and anonymous individuals. Archaeology also helps to clarify battles, which were often chaotic and only partially documented, and to understand better the patterns of political violence, whose effects were literally buried for over 70 years. The narrative starts with the coup against the Second Spanish Republic on 18 July 1936, follows the massacres and battles that marked the path of the war, and ends in the early 1950s, when the last forced labor camps were closed and the anti-Francoist guerrillas suppressed.  The book draws on 20 years of research to bring together perspectives from battlefield archaeology, archaeologies of internment, and forensics. It will be of interest to anybody interested in historical and contemporary archaeology, human rights violations, modern military history, and negative heritage.   Read more Read less"

"title : The Fall of Troy: a novel - author : Peter Ackroydcategory : archaeologydescription : Heinrich Obermann, a celebrated German archaeologist, has uncovered the ancient ruins of Troy on a Turkish hillside. He fervently believes that his discovery will prove that the heroes of the Iliad, a work he has cherished all his life, actually existed. Sophia, Obermann's young Greek wife, works at the site carefully preserving the ancient treasures she uncovers. But Sophia soon comes to see another side of her husband. He is mysteriously vague about his past and the wife he claims died years before. When she finds a cache of artefacts Obermann has hidden away, her suspicions about him rise, feelings that escalate when a visiting archaeologist who questions Obermann's methods dies from a mysterious fever. The arrival of a second, equally sceptical archaeologist brings Sophia's doubts to a head--and spurs Obermann to make even greater claims about the evidence he has found and the profound importance of his achievements.In The Fall of Troy, Peter Ackroyd again demonstrates his ability to evoke time and place, and to transform history into compelling fiction. Like the Homeric epics that entrance Obermann, The Fall of Troy is in part accurate, in part fantastic. It is a brilliantly told story of heroes and scoundrels, human aspirations and follies, and the temptation to shape the truth to fit a passionately held belief.   Read more Read less"

"title : The Sign and the Seal: The Quest for the Lost Ark of the Covenant - author : Graham Hancockcategory : archaeologydescription : A compelling brew of mystery, crime, and science revealing the details behind the search for the lost Ark of the Covenant.  The Lost Ark of the Covenant is one of the great historical mysteries of all time. To believers, the Ark is the legendary vessel holding the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. The Bible contains hundreds of references to the Ark's power to level mountains, destroy armies, and lay waste to cities. The Ark itself, however, mysteriously disappears from recorded history sometime after the building of the Temple of Solomon.  After ten years of searching through the dusty archives of Europe and the Middle East, as well as braving the real-life dangers of a bloody civil war in Ethiopia, Graham Hancock has succeeded where scores of others have failed. This intrepid journalist tracked down the true story behind the myths and legends--revealing where the Ark is today, how it got there, and why it remains hidden.  Part fascinating scholarship and part entertaining adventure yarn, tying together some of the most intriguing tales of all time--from the Knights Templar and Prester John to Parsival and the Holy Grail--this book will appeal to anyone fascinated by the revelation of hidden truths, the discovery of secret mysteries.

"title : Landscape in the Longue Duree - author : Christopher Tilleycategory : archaeologydescription : Pebbles are usually found only on the beach, in the liminal space between land and sea. But what happens when pebbles extend inland and create a ridge brushing against the sky? Landscape in the Longue Durée is a 4,000 year history of pebbles. It is based on the results of a four-year archaeological research project of the east Devon Pebblebed heathlands, a fascinating and geologically unique landscape in the UK whose bedrock is composed entirely of water-rounded pebbles. Christopher Tilley uses this landscape to argue that pebbles are like no other kind of stone – they occupy an especial place both in the prehistoric past and in our contemporary culture. It is for this reason that we must re-think continuity and change in a radically new way by considering embodied relations between people and things over the long term.    Dividing the book into two parts, Tilley first explores the prehistoric landscape from the Mesolithic to the end of the Iron Age, and follows with an analysis of the same landscape from the eighteenth into the twenty-first century. The major findings of the four-year study are revealed through this chronological journey: from archaeological discoveries, such as the excavation of three early Bronze Age cairns, to the documentation of all 829 surviving pebble structures, and beyond, to the impact of the landscape on local economies and its importance today as a military training camp. The results of the study will inform many disciplines including archaeology, cultural and art history, anthropology, conservation, and landscape studies.   Read more Read less"
"title : Salt production and social hierarchy in ancient China - author : Rowan K. Fladcategory : archaeologydescription : ""This book examines the organization of specialized salt production at Zhongba, one of the most important prehistoric sites in the Three Gorges of China's Yangzi River valley""--  ""This book examines the organization of specialized salt production at Zhongba, one of the most important prehistoric sites in the Three Gorges of China's Yangzi River valley. Rowan K. Flad demonstrates that salt production emerged in the second millennium BCE and developed into a large-scale, intense activity. As the intensity of this activity increased during the early Bronze Age, production became more coordinated, perhaps by an emergent elite who appear to have supported their position of authority by means of divination and the control of ritual knowledge. This study explores evidence of these changes in ceramics, the layout of space at the site, and animal remains. It synthesizes the data retrieved from years of excavation, showing not only the evolution of production methods, but also the emergence of social hierarchy in the Three Gorges region over two millennia""--   Read more Read less"

"title : The early barrow-diggers - author : Barry M. Marsdencategory : archaeologydescription : In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries barrow digging became a field sport for local squires and parsons. Their desire for decorative relics led them to plunder the graves of their prehistoric ancestors. With a few notable exceptions their methods were lamentable: their workmen recklessly destroyed remains and pottery, and few made accurate records. What was most horrifying was the speed at which they worked - one individual digging over 30 barrows in a day and 9 in the space of two hours! Against this background it is perhaps amazing that any idea of the importance of recording provenance and context developed at all. But, in this fascinating survey of early field archaeology in Britain, Barry Marsden is able to highlight the careers and methods of the more responsible barrow diggers - from the first excavations of William Stukeley in the 1720s to the more orderly and painstaking work of the main nineteenth-century practitioners, concluding with the exemplary operations of Lt. General Pitt Rivers in the 1880s and 1890s.

"title : The life of the longhouse: an archaeology of ethnicity - author : Peter Metcalfcategory : archaeologydescription : ""For two centuries, travellers were amazed at the massive buildings found along the rivers that flow from the mountainous interior of Borneo. They concentrated hundreds of people under one roof, in the middle of empty rainforests. There was no practical necessity for this arrangement, and it remains a mystery. Peter Metcalf provides an answer by showing the historical context, using both oral histories and colonial records. The key factor was a pre-modern trading system that funneled rare and exotic jungle products to China via the ancient coastal city of Brunei. Meanwhile the elite manufactured goods traded upriver shaped the political and religious institutions of longhouse society. However, the apparent permanence of longhouses was an illusion. In historical terms, longhouse communities were both mobile and labile, and the patterns of ethnicity they created more closely resemble the contemporary world than any stereotype of 'tribal' societies""--Provided by publisher.

"title : Creating and Governing Cultural Heritage in the European Union - author : Tuuli Lähdesmäkicategory : archaeologydescription : Creating and Governing Cultural Heritage in the European Union provides an interdisciplinary examination of the ways in which European cultural heritage is created, communicated, and governed via the European Heritage Label scheme. Drawing on ethnographic field research conducted at sites in ten countries that have been awarded with the European Heritage Label, the authors of the book approach heritage as an entangled social, spatial, temporal, discursive, narrative, performative, and embodied process. Recognising that heritage is inherently political and used by diverse actors as a tool for re-imagining communities, identities, and borders, and for generating notions of inclusion and exclusion in Europe, the book also considers the idea of Europe itself as a narrative. Chapters tackle issues such as multilevel governance of heritage; geopolitics of border-crossings and border-making; participation and non-participation; and embodiment and affective experience of heritage. Creating and Governing Cultural Heritage in the European Union advances heritage studies with an interdisciplinary approach that utilises and combines theories and conceptualizations from critical geopolitics, political studies, EU and European studies, cultural policy research, and cultural studies. As such, the volume will be of interest to scholars and students engaged in the study of heritage, politics, belonging, the EU, ideas and narratives of Europe.   Read more Read less"

"title : National Museums and Nation-Building in Europe 1750-2010 - author : Peter Aronssoncategory : archaeologydescription : Europe’s national museums have since their creation been at the centre of on-going nation making processes. National museums negotiate conflicts and contradictions and entrain the community sufficiently to obtain the support of scientists and art connoisseurs, citizens and taxpayers, policy makers, domestic and foreign visitors alike. National Museums and Nation-building in Europe 1750-2010 assess the national museum as a manifestation of cultural and political desires, rather than that a straightforward representation of the historical facts of a nation. National Museums and Nation-building in Europe 1750-2010 examines the degree to which national museums have created models and representations of nations, their past, present and future, and proceeds to assess the consequences of such attempts. Revealing how different types of nations and states – former empires, monarchies, republics, pre-modern, modern or post-imperial entities – deploy and prioritise different types of museums (based on art, archaeology, culture and ethnography) in their making, this book constitutes the first comprehensive and comparative perspective on national museums in Europe and their intricate relationship to the making of nations and states.

"title : Year Zero - author : Jeff Longcategory : archaeologydescription : An archaeological manhunt is raging in the holy land -- a hunt for the historical Jesus. For Nathan Lee Swift, a young American field researcher and expectant father, the line between noble discovery and the plunder of ruins is sacred -- until the night he crosses it. At a Roman landfill beneath the crucifixion grounds known as Golgotha, Nathan Lee yields to his professor's greed and turns common grave robber. His world -- his unborn daughter -- seems lost to him.     Hundreds of miles away, on the remote Greek island of Corfu, a wealthy collector pries open his latest black-market purchase -- a fourteen-inch holy relic containing a vial of blood dating back to the first century -- and unleashes a two-thousand-year-old plague. As the pandemic explodes from the Mediterranean basin and threatens to devour humankind, Nathan Lee gets a chance at redemption. He embarks on an Odyssean journey back to the United States to find his family.     Skirting the edges of the world, Nathan Lee's path finally leads him to New Mexico, where the greatest minds of science have converged at Los Alamos to find a vaccine. There Nathan Lee meets Miranda Abbot, a nineteen-year-old prodigy. As the cure continues to elude them, Miranda launches a desperate final strategy: the use of human lab rats cloned from the year zero. Nathan Lee, the thief of bones, comes face-to-face with men made from the very relics he looted, one of whom claims to be Jesus Christ, but may also be Patient Zero.   Read more Read less"

"title : The fire gospel - author : Michel Fabercategory : archaeologydescription : Theo Griepenkerl is a modest academic with an Olympian ego. When he visits a looted museum in Iraq, looking for treasures he can ship back to Canada, he finds nine papyrus scrolls that have lain hidden for two thousand years. Once translated from Aramaic, these prove to be a fifth Gospel, written by an eyewitness of Jesus Christ's last days. But when Theo decides to share this sensational discovery with the world, he fails to imagine the impact the new Gospel will have on Christians, Arabs, homicidal maniacs and Amazon customers alike. Like Prometheus's gift of fire, it has incendiary consquences. The Fire Gospel is an enthralling novel about the power of words to resonate across centuries, and inspire and disrupt in equal measure. Wickedly provocative, hilarious and shocking by turns, it is a revelatory piece of storytelling by a writer at the height of his powers.   Read more Read less"

The police fear a sexual serial killer is at work--something to be hushed up to keep the tourists calm. But the fear in the eyes of the locals says it all: the murders are starting again...     For American Stephanie Cahill, Bella Vista is a new beginning--a chance to put her painful past behind her. Yet, from the moment the first body is discovered at the site of an archeological dig, Stephanie feels as if she's being watched, followed, studied...hunted.  Archeologist Grant Peterson senses something odd about this dig, something that has him locking his door at night. And now, the echoes of a burial site's ancient legend can be found in the chilling signature of a killer on the loose.  The powerful attraction between Stephanie and Grant is a complication neither can afford as they are pulled into a desperate race against time to keep Stephanie from joining the ranks of the missing.

"title : Dwelling - author : Philip Tonnercategory : archaeologydescription : ""Dwelling: Heidegger, Archaeology, Mortality negotiates the discourses of phenomenology, archaeology and palaeoanthropology in order to extend the 'dwelling perspective', an approach in the social sciences particularly associated with Tim Ingold and a number of other thinkers, including Chris Tilley, Julian Thomas, Chris Gosden and Clive Gamble, that developed out of an engagement with the thought of Martin Heidegger. This unique book deals with Heidegger's philosophy as it has been explored in archaeology and anthropology, seeking to expand its cross-disciplinary engagement into accounts of early humans and death-awareness. Tonner reads Heidegger's thought of dwelling in connection to recent developments in the archaeology of mortuary practice amongst our ancestors. Agreeing with Heidegger that an awareness of death marks out a distinctive way of 'being-in-the-world', Tonner rejects any relict anthropocentrism in Heidegger's thought and seeks to break down simple divisions between humans and pre-humans. This book is ideal for readers wishing to cross disciplinary boundaries and to challenge anthropocentric thinking in accounts of human evolution. It would be ideal for professional researchers in the fields covered by the book as well as for graduate students and advanced undergraduates.""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less"

"title : Post critical museology - author : Andrew Dewdneycategory : archaeologydescription : ""Post Critical Museology examines the current status of learning and knowledge practices in the art museum and investigates how to understand the challenges presented by the visual cultures of global migration and new media. The book locates the discussion of the future of the art museum in the realm of public participation and engagement with art and the museum. It provides a new analytical synthesis of the art museum through accounting for the agency of different communities of users and using theoretical approaches associated with science and technology studies. In the book's terms the art museum is continually made and remade through related networks and instead of an approach that starts with traditional hierarchies of cultural knowledge and value, it develops an analysis of the art museum in terms of an extended set of objects and performances and examines the points of relationship between them. In this way the book shows how the art museum in the first decade of the twenty-first century is no longer governed by the civic and civilizing mission of the nineteenth century, nor ruled by the logic of Modernist rationalism, but instead, can be seen as an institution seeking a new social role and identity and currently still struggling to understand and negotiate wider cultural signifying systems, government policy and market forces. Locating its critique in a constructive relationship to international progressive museological thinking and practice, the book calls for a new alignment in what it announces as post-critical museology. An alignment that is committed to rethinking what an art museum in the twenty-first century could be, as well as what knowledge and understanding its future practitioners might mobilize in a rapidly changing social and cultural context. The book aims to be essential reading in the growing field of museum studies. It will also be of professional interest to all those working in the cultural sphere, including museum professionals, policy makers and art managers.

"title : The archaeology of the Holy Land - author : Jodi Magnesscategory : archaeologydescription : ""In the heart of the ancient Near East (modern Middle East) and at a crossroads between once mighty powers such as Assyria to the east and Egypt to the south is a tiny piece of land -- roughly the size of New Jersey -- that is as contested as it is sacred. One cannot even name this territory without sparking controversy. Originally called Canaan after its early inhabitants (the Canaanites), it has since been known by various names. To Jews this is Eretz-Israel (the Land of Israel), the Promised Land described by the Hebrew Bible as flowing with milk and honey. To Christians it is the Holy Land where Jesus Christ -- the messiah or anointed one -- was born, preached, and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice. Under the Greeks and Romans, it was the province of Judea, a name which hearkened back to the biblical kingdom of Judah. After the Bar-Kokhba revolt ended in 135 C.E., Hadrian renamed the province Syria-Palestina, reviving the memory of the long-vanished kingdom of Philistia. Under early Islamic rule the military district (jund) of Filastin was part of the province of Greater Syria (Arabic Bilad al-Sham).

Yet, despite this preeminence in the collective mind, Egypt has suffered considerable destruction over the centuries. Even before the burning of the Great Library at Alexandria, the land of the pharaohs was pillaged by its own people. With the arrival of foreign rulers, both Arabic and European, the destruction and thievery continued along with suppression of ancient knowledge as some rulers sought to cleanse Egypt of its “pagan” past.  Exploring the many cycles of destruction and suppression in Egypt as well as moments of salvation, such as the first registered excavations by Auguste Mariette, Robert Bauval and Ahmed Osman investigate the many conquerors of Egypt through the millennia as well as what has happened to famous artifacts such as the Rosetta Stone. They show how Napoleon, through his invasion, wanted to revive ancient Egyptian wisdom and art because of its many connections to Freemasonry. They reveal how the degradation of monuments, theft of relics, and censorship of ancient teachings continue to this day. Exposing recent cover-ups during the tenure of Antiquities Minister Zahi Hawass, they explain how new discoveries at Giza were closed to further research.  Clearing cultural and historical distortions, the authors reveal the long-hidden and persecuted voice of ancient Egypt and call for the return of Egypt to its rightful place as “the Mother of Nations” and “the Mirror of Heaven.”   Read more Read less"

"title : Ruin memories - author : Bjørnar Olsencategory : archaeologydescription : ""Since the 19th century, mass-production, consumerism and cycles of material replacement have accelerated; increasingly larger amounts of things are increasingly rapidly victimized and made redundant. At the same time processes of destruction have immensely intensified, although largely overlooked when compared to the research and social significance devoted to consumption and production. The outcome is a ruin landscape of derelict factories, closed shopping malls, overgrown bunkers and redundant mining towns; a ghostly world of decaying modern debris normally left out of academic concerns and conventional histories. The archaeology of the recent or contemporary past has grown fast during the last decade. This development has been concurrent with a broader popular, artistic and scholarly interest in modern ruins in general. Ruin Memories explores how the ruins of modernity are conceived and assigned cultural value in contemporary academic and public discourses, reassesses the cultural and historical value of modern ruins and suggests possible means for reaffirming their cultural and historic significance. Crucial for this reassessment is a concern with decay and ruination, and with the role things play in expressing the neglected, unsuccessful and ineffable. Abandonment and ruination is usually understood negatively through the tropes of loss and deprivation; things are degraded and humiliated while the information, knowledge and memory embedded in them become lost along the way. Without at all ignoring its many negative and traumatizing aspects, a main question addressed in this book is whether ruination also can be seen as an act of disclosure? If ruination disturbs the routinized and ready-to-hand, to what extent can it also be seen as a recovery of memory as exposing meanings and presences that perhaps are only possible to grasp at second hand when no longer immersed in their withdrawn and useful reality? Anybody interested in the archaeology of the contemporary past will find Ruin Memories an essential guide to the very latest theoretical research in this emerging field of archaeological thought""--   Read more Read less"

A twisting trail of bloodshed leads Pendergast and Constance to the maiden voyage of the Britannia, the world's largest and most luxurious ocean liner---and to an Atlantic crossing fraught with terror.

"title : Finders Keepers: A Tale of Archaeological Plunder and Obsession - author : Craig Childscategory : archaeologydescription : From Publishers Weekly    Childs (The Animal Dialogues) intermingles personal experiences as a desert ecologist and adventurer with a journalistic look at scientists, collectors, museum officials, and pot hunters to explore what should happen to ancient artifacts. Questioning whether artifacts should be left in place, Childs argues that although surface surveys and electronic imaging permit study of buried objects without digging, that reliance on technology risks the loss of the ""physical connection to the memory of ancient people."" Yet he mourns the loss of context that comes from removing, say, the Temple of Dendur from its natural environment. On the other hand, he scrutinizes the ""stewardship"" of past archeologists who removed sacred objects when ""o one thought indigenous cultures would survive to start demanding their things back,"" returns now required by U.S. law. Childs is critical of museum facilities inadequate to protect items that archeologists removed from their sites precisely to preserve them from destruction. He is also unhappy with the legal sale of relics to collectors, which he believes led to ""more digging and smuggling."" His own ""collection"" consists of finds he has left in place across the Southwest. But, he says, artifacts that cannot safely be left in place should go to museums. This is an engaging and thought-provoking look at one of the art and artifacts' world's most heated debates.     Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.  From Booklist    Childs treks the canyon-incised Colorado Plateau in search of pre-Columbian artifacts. Their legal regulation collides with collectors’ obsessions to possess them. Childs, though, does not remove what he finds, an ethic that vies with other precepts for the proper preservation of antiquities. For every stand he takes on archaeological morality in this narrative mix of his backcountry experiences and conversations with collectors, curators, dealers, and an occasional looter, Childs engages their justifications for taking custody of ancient objects. As if to underscore ethical fuzziness, Childs relays a personal story of when he absconded with a publicly displayed pot and secreted it in the desert––a theft in the service of righteous restoration? Or is it better to entrust cultural legacies to museums, which are overwhelmed with stuff already? Perhaps, then, private collections have a role in saving objects? Not to the professional archaeologists with whom Childs speaks; they’re horrified by amateurs’ destruction of information when they pry things from their physical context. Alternating romantic and practical moods, Childs hunts virtue as much as baskets in this engaging discourse. --Gilbert Taylor   Read more Read less"

"title : Egyptian Bioarchaeology - author : Salima Ikramcategory : archaeologydescription : This book consists of a series of essays that explore how ancient plant, animal, and human remains should be studied, and how, when they are integrated with texts, images, and artefacts, they can contribute to our understanding of the history, environment, and culture of ancient Egypt in a holistic manner. Topics covered in this volume relating to human remains include analyses of royal, elite and poor cemeteries of different eras, case studies on specific mummies, identification of different diseases in human remains, an overview of the state of palaeopathology in Egypt, how to analyse burials to establish season of death, the use of bodies to elucidate life stories, the potential of visceral remains in identifying individuals as well as diseases that they might have had, and a protocol for studying mummies. Faunal remains are represented by a study of a canine cemetery and a discussion of cat species that were mummified, and dendroarchaeology is represented by an overview of its potentials and pitfalls for dating Egyptian remains and revising its chronology. Leading international specialists from varied disciplines including physical anthropology, radiology, archaeozoology, Egyptology, and dendrochronology have contributed to this groundbreaking volume of essays that will no doubt provide much fodder for thought, and will be of interest to scholars and laypeople alike.

"title : Scattered Finds - author : Alice Stevensoncategory : archaeologydescription : Scattered Finds explores the politics, personalities and social histories that linked fieldwork in Egypt with the varied organizations around the world that received finds. Case studies range from Victorian municipal museums and women’s suffrage campaigns in the UK, to the development of some of the USA’s largest institutions, and from university museums in Japan to new institutions in post-independence Ghana. By juxtaposing a diversity of sites for the reception of Egyptian cultural heritage over the period of a century, Alice Stevenson presents new ideas about the development of archaeology, museums and the construction of Egyptian heritage. She also addresses the legacy of these practices, raises questions about the nature of the authority over such heritage today, and argues for a stronger ethical commitment to its stewardship.

"title : Prison power - author : Lisa M. Corrigancategory : archaeologydescription : ""In the Black liberation movement, imprisonment emerged a key rhetorical, theoretical, and media resource as activists developed tactics and ideology to counter white supremacy. As a site for both political and personal transformation, Lisa Corrigan underscores how imprisonment shaped movement leaders by influencing their political analysis and organizational strategies. Prison became the critical space for the transformation from civil rights to Black Power, especially as southern civil rights activists faced setbacks in achieving equality. Corrigan fills gaps between Black Power historiography and prison studies by scrutinizing the rhetorical forms and strategies of the Black Power ideology that arose from prison politics. These discourses demonstrate how Black Power activism shifted its tactics to regenerate, even after the FBI sought to disrupt, discredit, and destroy the movement""--   Read more Read less"

"title : The Routledge handbook of the bioarchaeology of human conflict - author : Christopher Knüselcategory : archaeologydescription : ""If human burials were our only window onto the past, what story would they tell? Skeletal injuries constitute the most direct and unambiguous evidence for violence in the past. Whereas weapons or defenses may simply be statements of prestige or status and written sources are characteristically biased and incomplete, human remains offer clear and unequivocal evidence of physical aggression reaching as far back as we have burials to examine. Warfare is often described as 'senseless' and as having no place in society. Consequently, its place in social relations and societal change remains obscure. The studies in The Routledge Handbook of the Bioarchaeology of Human Conflict present an overview of the nature and development of human conflict from prehistory to recent times as evidenced by the remains of past people themselves in order to explore the social contexts in which such injuries were inflicted. A broadly chronological approach is taken from prehistory through to recent conflicts, however this book is not simply a catalogue of injuries illustrating weapon development or a narrative detailing 'progress' in warfare but rather provides a framework in which to explore both continuity and change based on a range of important themes which hold continuing relevance throughout human development""--   Read more Read less"

"title : The Age of Everything - author : Matthew Hedmancategory : archaeologydescription : Taking advantage of recent advances throughout the sciences, Matthew Hedman brings the distant past closer to us than it has ever been. Here, he shows how scientists have determined the age of everything from the colonization of the New World over 13,000 years ago to the origin of the universe nearly fourteen billion years ago. Hedman details, for example, how interdisciplinary studies of the Great Pyramids of Egypt can determine exactly when and how these incredible structures were built. He shows how the remains of humble trees can illuminate how the surface of the sun has changed over the past ten millennia. And he also explores how the origins of the earth, solar system, and universe are being discerned with help from rocks that fall from the sky, the light from distant stars, and even the static seen on television sets. Covering a wide range of time scales, from the Big Bang to human history, The Age of Everything is a provocative and far-ranging look at how science has determined the age of everything from modern mammals to the oldest stars, and will be indispensable for all armchair time travelers.

"title : Glow - author : Amy Kathleen Ryancategory : anthropologydescription : If a violent battle destroyed the only world you’ve ever known, would you be brave enough to save who was left? Would love be strong enough to survive the fight? Either way, there’s no turning back.  The Empyrean is the only home 15-year-old Waverly has ever known. Part of the first generation to be successfully conceived in deep space, she and her boyfriend Kieran will be pioneers of New Earth. Waverly knows she must marry young in order to have children who can carry on the mission, and Kieran, the handsome captain-to-be, has everything Waverly could want in a husband. Everyone is sure he’s the best choice. Still, there’s a part of Waverly that wants more from life than marriage, and she is secretly intrigued by the shy, darkly brilliant Seth.  Suddenly, Waverly’s dreams are interrupted by the inconceivable – a violent betrayal by the Empyrean's sister ship, the New Horizon. The New Horizon’s leaders are desperate to populate the new planet first, and will do anything to get what they need: young girls. In one pivotal moment, Waverly and Kieran are separated, and find themselves at the helm of dangerous missions, where every move has potentially devastating consequences, and decisions of the heart may lead to disaster.

"title : The politics of passion - author : Gloria Wekkercategory : anthropologydescription : Gloria Wekker analyzes the phenomenon of mati work, an old practice among Afro-Surinamese working-class women in which marriage is rejected in favor of male and female sexual partners. Wekker vividly describes the lives of these women, who prefer to create alternative families of kin, lovers, and children, and gives a fascinating account of women's sexuality that is not limited to either heterosexuality or same-sex sexuality.  She offers new perspectives on the lives of Caribbean women, transnational gay and lesbian movements, and an Afro-Surinamese tradition that challenges conventional Western notions of marriage, gender, identity, and desire. Bringing these women's voices to the forefront, she offers an extensive and groundbreaking analysis of the unique historical, religious, psychological, economic, linguistic, cultural, and political forces that have shaped their lives.

"title : American Indian languages - author : Lyle Campbellcategory : anthropologydescription : Native American languages are spoken from Siberia to Greenland, and from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego; they include the southernmost language of the world (Yaghan) and some of the northernmost (Eskimoan). Campbell's project is to take stock of what is currently known about the history ofNative American languages and in the process examine the state of American Indian historical linguistics, and the success and failure of its various methodologies.   There is remarkably little consensus in the field, largely due to the 1987 publication of Language in the Americas by Joseph Greenberg. He claimed to trace a historical relation between all American Indian languages of North and South America, implying that most of the Western Hemisphere wassettled by a single wave of immigration from Asia. This has caused intense controversy and Campbell, as a leading scholar in the field, intends this volume to be, in part, a response to Greenberg...   Read more Read less"

El ángulo de visión que adopta el autor no es ni el de la antropología física ni el de la antropología social o cultural. Es, más bien, el de una cierta antropología filosófica, o simplemente el de una posición filosofante, reflexiva, que va más allá que la de la estricta ciencia. Por consiguiente, los análisis socioculturales -situados en el plano científico- se presentan notablemente esquemati­zados, con e! fin de ir captando el método puesto en acción y de ir centrando la atención en la teoría y en la concepción filosófica del hombre, conforme aparece en e! pensamiento de Lévi-Strauss.

"title : Anthropology for Muslim Students - author : Hamid Parsaniacategory : anthropologydescription : This present work takes as its point of departure the origin of man and traces, in a “historical” fashion, his movement away from that origin.  It concludes with the arrival of man on the material plane of existence and his accelerating descent into the modern world.  By lucidly describing this journey and the symp-toms and underlying causes of the present quagmire, it suggests a solution and a general course of action to be taken.  This resolu-tion of the current crisis and discord corresponds to man’s return to his origin and the ascent towards his final destination and goal.  On the individual level, it means to embark upon the spir-itual journey towards God, a journey that includes self-knowledge and self-purification.  On the social plane, it means to cultivate a society that accords with Divine Guidance and conforms to Divine Law and which provides an environment that attracts, nourishes and sustains its inhabitants on a path of spiritual wayfaring.    The text in hand is a modified and abbreviated version of the book Existence and the Fall: Spiritual Anthropology of Islam by Hamid Parsania and is intended to be used as a final year high-school textbook in Islamic schools that teach humanities.

Indigenous parties have managed to win support across ethnic lines because the long history of racial mixing in Latin America blurred ethnic boundaries and reduced ethnic polarization. The appeals of the indigenous parties have especially resonated in the Andean countries because of widespread disenchantment with the region's traditional parties.

"title : How chiefs became kings: divine kingship and the rise of archaic states in ancient Hawai'i - author : Patrick Vinton Kirchcategory : anthropologydescription : In How Chiefs Became Kings, PKirch addresses a central problem in anthropological archaeology: the emergence of ""archaic states"" whose distinctive feature was divine kingship. Kirch takes as his focus the Hawaiian archipelago, commonly regarded as the archetype of a complex chiefdom. Integrating anthropology, linguistics, archaeology, traditional history, and theory, and drawing on significant contributions from his own four decades of research, Kirch argues that Hawaiian polities had become states before the time of Captain Cook's voyage (1778-1779). The status of most archaic states is inferred from the archaeological record. But Kirch shows that because Hawai'i's kingdoms were established relatively recently, they could be observed and recorded by Cook and other European voyagers. Substantive and provocative, this book makes a major contribution to the literature of precontact Hawai'i and illuminates Hawai'i's importance in the global theory and literature about divine, kingship, archaic states, and sociopolitical evolution. --Jacket.

"title : Communicating the history of medicine - author : Solveig Jülichcategory : anthropologydescription : Communicating the History of Medicine critically assesses the idea of audience and communication in medical history. This collection offers a range of case studies on academic outreach from historical and current perspectives. It questions the kind of linear thinking often found in policy or research assessment, instead offering a more nuanced picture of both the promises and pitfalls of engaging audiences for research in the humanities.  For whom do academic researchers in the humanities write? For academics and, indirectly, at least for students, but there are hopes that work reaches broader audiences and that it will have an impact on policy or among professional experts outside of the humanities. Today impact is more and more discussed in the context of research assessment. Seen from a media theoretical perspective, impact may however be described as a case of 'audiencing' and the creation of audiences by means of media technologies.   Read more Read less"
"title : Sign Languages in Village Communities - author : Ulrike Zeshancategory : anthropologydescription : This book unites the work of both anthropologists and linguists who have conducted fieldwork in rural signing communities around the globe. In most cases, these signing communities have emerged in response to a high incidence of (often hereditary) deafness. In contrast to the national sign languages used in urban deaf communities, these indigenous sign languages are typically shared between deaf and hearing community members, thus facilitating a high degree of integration between deaf and hearing individuals.

How do people actually quote today, and how did our present systems come about? This book brings together a down-to-earth account of contemporary quoting with an examination of the comparative and historical background that lies behind it and the characteristic way that quoting links past and present, the far and the near. Drawing from anthropology, cultural history, folklore, cultural studies, sociolinguistics, literary studies and the ethnography of speaking, Ruth Finnegan’s fascinating study sets our present conventions into cross-cultural and historical perspective. She traces the curious history of quotation marks, examines the long tradition of quotation collections with their remarkable recycling across the centuries, and explores the uses of quotation in literary, visual and oral traditions. The book tracks the changing definitions and control of quoting over the millennia and in doing so throws new light on ideas such as 'imitation', 'allusion', 'authorship', 'originality' and 'plagiarism'.

"title : The restless anthropologist - author : Alma Gottliebcategory : anthropologydescription : What does a move from a village in the West African rain forest to a West African community in a European city entail?  What about a shift from a Greek sheep-herding community to working with evictees and housing activists in Rome and Bangkok?  In The Restless Anthropologist, Alma Gottlieb brings together eight eminent scholars to recount the riveting personal and intellectual dynamics of uprooting one’s life—and decades of work—to embrace a new fieldsite.    Addressing questions of life-course, research methods, institutional support, professional networks, ethnographic models, and disciplinary paradigm shifts, the contributing writers of The Restless Anthropologist discuss the ways their earlier and later projects compare on both scholarly and personal levels, describing the circumstances of their choices and the motivations that have emboldened them to proceed, to become novices all over again. In doing so, they question some of the central expectations of their discipline, reimagining the space of the anthropological fieldsite at the heart of their scholarly lives.   Read more Read less"

"title : The silence of animals - author : John Graycategory : anthropologydescription : The powerful, beautiful and chilling sequel to the bestselling Straw Dogs John Gray draws on an extraordinary array of memoirs, poems, fiction and philosophy to make us re-imagine our place in the world. Writers as varied as Ballard, Borges, Freud and Conrad are mesmerised by forms of human extremity - experiences on the outer edge of the possible, or which tip into fantasy and myth. What happens to us when we starve, when we fight, when we are imprisoned? And how do our imaginations leap into worlds way beyond our real experience? The Silence of Animals is consistently fascinating, filled with unforgettable images and a delight in the conundrum of our existence - an existence which we decorate with countless myths and ideas, where we twist and turn to avoid acknowledging that we too are animals, separated from the others perhaps only by our self-conceit. In the Babel we have created for ourselves, it is the silence of animals that both reproaches and bewitches us.   Read more Read less"
"title : What's Wrong with Us - author : Colin Felthamcategory : anthropologydescription : What's wrong with us? Professor Colin Feltham believes that the current crises of the human condition are symptoms of a chronic wayward tendency which he terms 'anthropathology'. This interdisciplinary look at the zeitgeist of crisis traces the roots of human suffering, exploring the contemporary issues of human violence, deceit, patriarchy, abuse, irrationality and greed. Our human anthropathology is placed at the heart of all such problems. Echoing the pessimism of Schopenhauer, Cioran, Beckett, Gray and others, Feltham nevertheless insists that answers may be formulated through confrontation. Challenging and enlightening for professionals, academics and students, What's Wrong With Us?  is also a fascinating read for anyone with a general interest in our current social state.

"title : When death draws near - author : Carrie Stuart Parkscategory : anthropologydescription : ""Gwen Marcey takes death in stride. Until she's faced with her own mortality. Forensic artist Gwen Marcey is between jobs when she accepts temporary work in Pikeville, Kentucky--a small town facing big-city crime. But before Gwen can finish her first drawing of the serial rapist who is on the loose, the latest witness vanishes. Just like all the others. Gwen suspects a connection between the rapist and the ""accidental"" deaths that are happening around town, but the local sheriff has little interest in her theories. When her digitally-obsessed teenage daughter joins her there, Gwen turn her attention to a second assignment: going undercover in a serpent-handling church. She could get a handsome reward for uncovering illegal activity there--a reward she desperately needs, as it seems her breast cancer has returned. But snakes aren't the only ones ready to kill. Can Gwen uncover the truth--and convince anyone to believe her--before she becomes a victim herself? In a thrilling race against time, When Death Draws Near plunges us into cold-case murders, shady politics, and a den of venomous suspects""--  ""Death has always been part of Gwen Marcey's job.

"title : Moroccan Fashion - author : M. Angela Jansencategory : anthropologydescription : ""Moroccan garment design and consumption have experienced major shifts in recent history, transforming from a traditional craft-based enterprise to a thriving fashion industry. Influenced by western fashion, dress has become commoditized and has expanded from tailoring to designer labels. This book presents the first detailed ethnographic study of Moroccan fashion. Drawing on interviews with three generations of designers and the lifestyle press, the author provides an in-depth analysis of the development of urban dress, which reveals how traditional dress has not been threatened but rather produced and consumed in different ways. With chapters examining themes such as dress and politics, gender, faith, modernity, and exploring topics from craft to e-fashion, this book will be essential reading for students and scholars of fashion, anthropology, material culture, sociology, cultural studies, gender studies and related fields""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Good neighbors, bad times: echoes of my father's German village - author : Mimi Schwartzcategory : anthropologydescription : Mimi Schwartz grew up on milkshakes and hamburgers—and her father’s boyhood stories. She rarely took the stories seriously. What was a modern American teenager supposed to make of these accounts of a village in Germany where, according to her father, “before Hitler, everyone got along”? It was only many years later, when she heard a remarkable story of the Torah from that very village being rescued by Christians on Kristallnacht, that Schwartz began to sense how much these stories might mean. Thus began a twelve-year quest that covered three continents as Schwartz sought answers in the historical records and among those who remembered that time. Welcomed into the homes of both the Jews who had fled the village fifty years earlier and the Christians who had remained, Schwartz peered into family albums, ate home-baked linzertorte (almost everyone served it!), and heard countless stories about life in one small village before, during, and after Nazi times. Sometimes stories overlapped, sometimes one memory challenged another, but always they seemed to muddy the waters of easy judgment. Small stories of decency are often overlooked in the wake of a larger historic narrative. Yet we need these stories to provide a moral compass, especially in times of political extremism, when fear and hatred strain the bonds of loyalty and neighborly compassion. How, this book asks, do neighbors maintain a modicum of decency in such times? How do we negotiate evil and remain humane when, as in the Nazi years, hate rules?   Read more Read less"

"title : Global Divas - author : Martin F. Manalansan IVcategory : anthropologydescription : A vivid ethnography of the global and transnational dimensions of gay identity as lived by Filipino immigrants in New York City, Global Divas challenges beliefs about the progressive development of a gay world and the eventual assimilation of all queer folks into gay modernity. Insisting that gay identity is not teleological but fraught with fissures, Martin Manalansan IV describes how Filipino gay immigrants, like many queers of color, are creating alternative paths to queer modernity and citizenship. He makes a compelling argument for the significance of diaspora and immigration as sites for investigating the complexities of gender, race, and sexuality.  Manalansan locates diasporic, transnational, and global dimensions of gay and other queer identities within a framework of quotidian struggles ranging from everyday domesticity to public engagements with racialized and gendered images to life-threatening situations involving AIDS. He reveals the gritty, mundane, and often contradictory deeds and utterances of Filipino gay men as key elements of queer globalization and transnationalism. Through careful and sensitive analysis of these men’s lives and rituals, he demonstrates that transnational gay identity is not merely a consumable product or lifestyle, but rather a pivotal element in the multiple, shifting relationships that queer immigrants of color mobilize as they confront the tribulations of a changing world.

"title : THE EIGHTEENTH DYNASTY TITLES ROYAL NURSE (MN'T NSWT), ROYAL TUTOR (MN' NSWT), AND FOSTER BROTHER/SISTER OF THE LORD OF THE TWO LANDS (SN/SNT MN' N NB T3WY) (EGYPT) - author : Catharine Hershey Roehrigcategory : anthropologydescription : Men and women entrusted with the upbringing of the royal children were highly honored members of Egyptian society in Dynasty 18. Although there were probably nurses and tutors in earlier times, specific titles identifying people as ""royal nurse"" (mn't nswt) or ""royal tutor"" (mn' nswt), only seem to occur during Dynasty 18. These individuals are known from a variety of sources, including tombs, funerary equipment, and statuary. A few are well known figures in Egyptian history; others are almost completely undocumented.  The types of monuments that have been preserved are revealing. Most intriguing are the representations that depict a nurse or tutor holding one or more of the royal children. This kind of representation, showing a non-royal person in close physical contact with a member of the royal family, is unprecedented in Egyptian art. Even more unusual are the examples that show a nurse or tutor holding the nursling as a miniature ruler. Affectionate gestures of the figures towards one another clearly indicate that the artist was attempting to represent the very close bond that existed between them. The existence of the title ""one who nurtured the God"" (v sd/sdt ntr) shows that this relationship was given special honor if the nursling became king.  Evidence suggests that tutors were a combination of guardian and teacher, chosen because of their experience and ability. Nurses seem to have acted as wet-nurses, and some of their children shared a milk-bond with their mother's nursling, reflected in the rare title ""foster brother/sister"" (sn/snt n mn'). It is unclear how nurses were chosen, but it is possible that they had blood ties with the royal family.  The husband of a nurse had no official function with regard to his wife's nursling but the fact that a man's wife had suckled a child probably would have bound him to that child as well. This may account for the unusually large number of nurses who are connected with Amenhotep II as a child. Tuthmosis III may have feared that his son would inherit while still a minor and may have been binding a group of strong and trusted courtiers to the prince.

"title : The Face Of Deception - author : Iris Johansencategory : anthropologydescription : After losing her beloved child to a serial killer, forensic sculptor Eve Duncan survives by focusing on her career. The best in her field at rebuilding faces from bare skull bones, Eve specializes in identifying missing children. When billionaire John Logan requests her help in identifying an adult skull, Eve--already swamped with work--tells Logan that she isn't interested. But when he volunteers to donate a large sum of money to a charity for missing children in exchange for her time, Eve reluctantly agrees. Logan neglects to tell her that there are powerful, desperate people who are determined to keep the skull's true identity a secret at any cost. Eve's gut instincts tell her that Logan is holding back vital information: Does the billionaire really believe that he's uncovered new insight into the Kennedy assassination? Or does the skull tie him to a mysterious murder? Eve's wildest guesses don't even come close to the stunning truth that she discovers when she at last studies the restored face. Now she and Logan have proof of a dark secret that could get them killed. And it will take all of their combined cunning and sheer nerve to survive.

"title : Desert and water gardens of the Red Sea - author : Cyril Crosslandcategory : anthropologydescription : Cyril Crossland (1878–1943) was Director of the Sudan Pearl Fishery between 1905 and 1922. At this time, the British colonial government had taken charge of running the fishery, with local fishermen as employees. A marine biologist and zoologist, Crossland was praised in his obituary in the journal Nature as 'one of the last explorer-naturalists of the Darwin type'. This book is both an account of his life in the Sudan and a scientific survey of the coral reefs on the Red Sea coast. It offers a lively description of the region, its people and customs, and a clear, accessible explanation of the development of coral reefs. In Crossland's time this region had not been fully mapped by Western explorers and this study was an important contribution to knowledge. The book is illustrated with many of Crossland's own photographs of landscapes and people and his diagrams of the coral reefs.   Read more Read less"

"title : Master poets, ritual masters - author : James J. Foxcategory : anthropologydescription : This is a study in oral poetic composition. It examines how oral poets compose their recitations. Specifically, it is a study of the recitations of 17 separate master poets from the Island of Rote recorded over a period of 50 years. Each of these poets offers his version of what is culturally considered to be the ‘same’ ritual chant. These compositions are examined in detail and their oral formulae are carefully compared to one another. Professor James J. Fox is an anthropologist who carried out his doctoral field research on the Island of Rote in eastern Indonesia in 1965–66. In 1965, he began recording the oral traditions of the island and developed a close association with numerous oral poets on the island. After many subsequent visits, in 2006, he began a nine-year project that brought groups of oral poets to Bali for week-long recording sessions. Recitations gathered over a period of 50 years are the basis for this book.   Read more Read less"

"title : Falling into the lesbi world - author : Evelyn Blackwoodcategory : anthropologydescription : Falling into the Lesbi World offers a compelling view of sexual and gender difference through the everyday lives of tombois and their girlfriends (femmes) in the city of Padang, West Sumatra. While likening themselves to heterosexual couples, tombois and femmes contest and blur dominant constructions of gender and heterosexuality. Tombois are masculine females who identify as men and desire women; their girlfriends view themselves as normal women who desire men.  Through rich, in-depth, and provocative stories, author Evelyn Blackwood shows how these same-sex Indonesian couples negotiate transgressive identities and desires and how their experiences speak to the struggles and desires of sexual and gender minorities everywhere. Blackwood analyzes the complex and seemingly contradictory practices of tombois and their partners, demonstrating how they make sense of Islamic, transnational, and modern state discourses in ways that seem to align with normative gender and sexual categories while at the same time subverting them.  The childhood and adolescent narratives of tombois and femmes offer bold new insights into a social process that is rarely addressed in anthropological, lesbian, gay, or transgender studies. We see how tombois and femmes come to view themselves as boys and girls, respectively, through their interactions with family and community, and how as teenagers tombois learn that masculinity needs its opposite: feminine women. By contrast femmes notice shifts in their desires as they develop long-term relationships with tombois.  The book reveals the complexity of tomboi masculinity, showing how tombois enact both masculine and feminine behaviors as they move between the anonymity and vulnerability of public spaces and the familiarity of family spaces. Falling into the Lesbi World demonstrates how nationally and globally circulating queer discourses are received and reinterpreted by tombois and femmes in a city in Indonesia. Though less educated than many internet-savvy activists in major urban centers, their identities are clearly both part of yet different than global gay models of sexuality.  In contrast to the international LGBT model of modern sexualities, this work reveals a multiplicity of sexual and gender subjectivities in Indonesia, arguing for the importance of recognizing and validating this diversity in the global gay ecumene.

"title : Foggy social structures - author : Michael Bommescategory : anthropologydescription : European countries are currently involved in several irregular migration systems, resulting in undocumented populations estimated at several millions. They manage to live and work for years without a certified identity -- a phenomenon that challenges existing notions of political statehood and societal membership. Drawing on empirical studies carried out in a variety of settings, the authors of this illuminating study analyse the ways in which such irregular migration systems developed over time, interacting with changes in European labour markets, welfare regimes and immigration policies.

"title : Labour Migration in Malaysia and Spain - author : Blanca Garcés-Mascareñascategory : anthropologydescription : State regulation of labour migration is confronted with a double paradox. First, while markets require a policy of open borders to fulfill demands for migrant workers, the boundaries of citizenship impose some degree of closure to the outside. Second, while the exclusivity of citizenship requires closed membership, civil and human rights undermine the state's capacity to exclude foreigners once they are in the country. By considering how Malaysia and Spain have responded to the demand for foreign labour, this book analyses what may be identified as the trilemma between markets, citizenship and rights. For though their markets are similar, the two countries have different approaches to citizenship and rights. We must thus ask: how do such divergences affect state responses to market demands and how, in turn, do state regulations impact labour migration flows? And what does this mean for contemporary migration overall?   Read more Read less"

"title : Healing elements - author : Sienna R. Craigcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Tibetan medicine has come to represent multiple and sometimes conflicting agendas. On the one hand it must retain a sense of cultural authenticity and a connection to Tibetan Buddhism; on the other it must be proven efficacious and safe according to biomedical standards, often through clinical research. Recently, Tibetan medicine has found a place within the multibillion-dollar market for complementary, traditional, and herbal medicines as people around the world seek alternative paths to wellness. Healing Elements explores Tibetan medicine within diverse settings, from rural schools and clinics in the Nepal Himalaya to high-tech factories and state-supported colleges in the People's Republic of China. This multi-sited ethnography explores how Tibetan medicines circulate as commercial goods and gifts, as target therapies, and as panacea for biosocial ills. Through an exploration of efficacy - What does it mean to say Tibetan medicine ""works""? - this book illustrates a bio-politics of traditional medicine in the twenty-first century. Healing Elements examines the ways traditional medicine interacts with biomedicine: from patient-healer relationships and the cultural meanings ascribed to affliction, to the wider circumstances in which practitioners are trained, healing occurs, and medicines are made, evaluated, and used. As such, it examines the meaningful, if contested, translations of science and healing that occur across distinct social ecologies""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less"
"title : Fair trade from the ground up - author : April Lintoncategory : anthropologydescription : ""Fair Trade promises to raise living standards in developing countries through: - worldwide minimum prices for commodities - support for democratically governed cooperatives - requirement of minimum wages and safety standards for workers - training to help producers improved quality and develop business skills - encouragement of eco-friendly practices - third-party certification In contrast to the free trade status quo, Fair Trade relies on informed consumers to choose more direct supply chains that minimize the role of middlemen, offering economic justice and social change as a viable and sustainable alternative to charity. But does it work? Fair Trade from the Ground Up documents achievements at both the producer and the consumer ends of commodity chains and assesses prospects for future growth. From Guatemalan coffee farmers to student activists on U.S. college campuses, the stories of individuals inform April Linton's analysis. Drawing on studies by social scientists and economists, as well as on new case studies, she provides balanced answers to hard questions: How can large institutions be persuaded to commit to using Fair Trade suppliers? Does ethical consumerism work? Are the ""social premiums"" that are built into Fair Trade prices really being used for community projects? Will Fair Trade market growth reach the scale of organics or green products? This book meets a long-felt need among economic-justice activists, consumer groups, and academics for a reliable qualitative and quantitative overview of achievements of the Fair Trade movement.

Does this mean that Russians perceive these colors differently from Japanese people?

This opinionated book addresses the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which argues that the language we speak shapes the way we perceive the world. Linguist John McWhorter argues that while this idea is mesmerizing, it is plainly wrong... McWhorter shows not only how the idea of language as a lens fails but also why we want so badly to believe it: we're eager to celebrate diversity by acknowledging the intelligence of peoples who may not think like we do. Though well-intentioned, our belief in this idea poses an obstacle to a better understanding of human nature and even trivializes the people we seek to celebrate.

"title : Was wir grundlegend sind: Menschen unter anderen biologischen Einzeldingen - author : Gerson Reutercategory : anthropologydescription : Das Buch ist im Kern eine Verteidigung der These, dass wir wesentlich biologische Lebewesen der Spezies Homo sapiens sind ? und nicht etwa wesentlich Personen. Diese These hat Konsequenzen für das Problem der personalen Identität. Ein wichtiger Aspekt ihrer Verteidigung ? und der zweite zentrale Argumentationsstrang des Buchs ? liegt demnach darin, zu begründen, dass wir die diachronen Identitätsbedingungen biologischer Lebewesen haben. Der Versuch, beide Argumentstationsziele zu erreichen, muss einige Hürden nehmen: angefangen von einer Motivierung eines passenden ontologischen Rahmens über eine Erläuterung des Begriffs des Lebewesens bis hin zu dem Nachweis, dass ein Essentialismus heutzutage noch eine gangbare Option ist. Auf diese Weise entsteht nach und nach ein Bild, das uns Menschen, als Lebewesen unter anderen Lebewesen, in eine biologische Welt einordnet, ohne dabei aber kleinzureden, dass wir, zumindest typischerweise, auch Personen mit einem reichhaltigen geistigen Leben sind.0.

"title : Ten theories of human nature - author : Leslie Stevensoncategory : anthropologydescription : Over four previous editions, Ten Theories of Human Nature has been a remarkably popular introduction to some of the most influential developments in Western and Eastern thought. This fifth edition features a new chapter on Buddhism and a completely revised and reorganized chapter on Darwinian theories. Lucid and accessible, Ten Theories of Human Nature, Fifth Edition, compresses into a small space the essence of such ancient traditions as Confucianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and the Old and New Testaments as well as the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, Karl Marx, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The authors juxtapose the ideas of these and  other thinkers and traditions in a way that helps readers understand how humanity has struggled to comprehend its nature. To encourage readers to think critically for themselves and to underscore the similarities and differences between the many theories, the book examines each one on four points--the nature of the universe, the nature of humanity, the diagnosis of the ills of humanity, and the proposed cure for these problems. Ideal for introductory courses in human nature, philosophy, religious studies, and intellectual history, Ten Theories of Human Nature, Fifth Edition, will engage and motivate students and other readers to consider how we can understand and improve both ourselves and human society   Read more Read less"
"title : El animal público: hacia una antropología de los espacios urbanos - author : Manuel Delgado Ruizcategory : anthropologydescription : ¿Qué es lo urbano sino una forma de vida hecha de sociabilidades minimalistas, pactos sobre la marcha, vínculos precarios que proliferan y se conectan entre sí hasta el infinito? La sociedad urbana no la conforman comunidades homogéneas, congruentes, atrincheradas cada una en su respectiva cuadrícula territorial, sino los actores desconocidos de una alteridad que se generaliza. Por ello, se plantea aquí la urgencia de una antropología que atienda a todo lo que en una ciudad puede ser visto flotando en su superficie, estructuras líquidas, ejes que organizan la vida social en torno suyo, pero que raras veces son instituciones estables, sino una pauta de fluctuaciones, la labor interminable de una sociedad sobre sí misma. Una antropología así concebida sería una disciplina que estudiara los espacios públicos, esas extensiones en las que se dan todo tipo de trenzamientos y bifurcaciones, escenificaciones que no se debería dudar en calificar de coreográficas. Su objeto: el animal público, ese personaje de múltiples rostros que pasa su tiempo desplegando ardides, confundiéndose con el terreno, aprovechando los accidentes de los paisajes por los que transita. Esta obra abre el camino hacia unas ciencias sociales que se ocupan de lo incierto, incalculable y oscilante que hay en la vida cotidiana, lo inconsistente y lo humano que emerge incansable e inesperadamente aquí y allá en la calle, ese umbral permeable, lábil, sin órganos, en que se puede experimentar la desolación y el desamparo más absolutos, pero en que también es posible escapar, desviarse, desobedecer, desertar, y hacerlo molecularmente o en masa. Espacio público: espacio rigurosamente vigilado por todos los poderes, por ser el espacio predilecto de las emancipaciones y las estampidas.   Read more Read less"

Later published in several articles and in 1972 as Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America, Newton's work represented the first major anthropological study of a homosexual community in the United States, and laid some of the groundwork for theorists such as Judith Butler, who would later explore the performative dimensions of sex and gender roles.

"title : THE LIVING END: LIMINALITY IN AN AMERICAN NURSING HOME (JEWISH) - author : Renee Rose Shieldcategory : anthropologydescription : Ethnographic research was conducted for fourteen months in a 250-bed, non-profit, Jewish nursing home with superior staffing ratios and facilities. The average age of the residents was approximately 85 years, and the average length of stay was approximately three years. Residents' nursing needs ranged from minimal care to continuous, skilled nursing care. At least fifty percent of the residents exhibited some senile dementia. Methodology included participant-observation, open-ended interviews, the taping of life histories, and the collection of demographic data from admissions since 1970. Research centered on resident mobility (room changes within the institution and hospitalizations), the nature of community formation and dissolution, patterns of staff and resident interactions, the limitations on reciprocal relations, and the nature of nursing home residence as a rite of passage event.  Life in this total institution is complicated by divisive staff beliefs characterized in the dissertation as: home versus hospital, life versus quality of life, and maintenance versus rehabilitation. Few staff members have knowledge of Jewish beliefs or history. Residents experience multiple hospitalizations and room changes. Entrance into this nursing home is a rite of passage with no solidifying rituals which prepare residents for the next stage, death. Stripped of past associations (separation), the transition (liminality) constitutes an end in itself because the occurrence of death (reincorporation) is combatted by medical intervention, the subject of death is avoided in staff interactions with residents, and the event of death is unmarked by official notice and ceremony.  Furthermore, the residents are recipients with few resources to exchange, no need to help each other, and no reason to contribute to the institution. Unlike initiates who perform tasks and are educated before advancing to the next stage, these residents receive services and cannot reciprocate. Their release from obligations reduces their control over their lives. Therefore, conflicting staff goals, a frail and heterogeneous resident population, frequent hospitalizations, restrictions on reciprocity, and the avoidance of death together prevent the formation of rituals and the emergence of staff or resident community, and exacerbate isolation and dependency among the residents.

"title : L'uomo possibile - author : Alessandro De Bonocategory : anthropologydescription : La problematicità dell'esistenza pone ciascun uomo dinanzi al rischio di consumarla impersonalmente. ""L'uomo possibile"", attraverso percorsi heideggeriani, vuole proporre il tema di una riflessione personale che aiuti l'uomo a riconquistare se stesso. ""I pensatori che lasciano un segno - scrive il filosofo Giuseppe Maria Sciacca nella prefazione del libro - sono tali quando il loro pensiero respira nei pensieri degli altri. Heidegger di Essere e tempo è l'interlocutore non molto nascosto e silenzioso di questo tentativo di percorrere uno dei suoi sentieri interrotti. Alessandro De Bono lo conduce con intimo travaglio e appassionata partecipazione. Essere e tempo coniugati con l'essere per la morte costituisce il polo essenziale del discorso che egli instaura con Heidegger, ma per raggiungere altre mete"".   Read more Read less"

"title : Transgressions - author : Ingereth Macfarlanecategory : anthropologydescription : This volume brings together an innovative set of readings of complex interactions between Australian Aboriginal people and colonisers. The underlying theme is that of ‘transgression’, and Michel Foucault’s account of the necessary dynamic that exists between transgression and limit. We know what constitutes the limit, not by tracing or re-stating the boundaries, but by crossing over them. By exploring the mechanisms by which limits are set and maintained, unexamined cultural assumptions and dominant ideas are illuminated. We see the expectations and the structures that inform and support them revealed, often as they unravel. Such illuminations and revelations are at the core of the Australian Indigenous histories presented in this collection.   Read more Read less"
"title : Tropical Forests Of Oceania. Anthropological Perspectives - author : Joshua A. Bellcategory : anthropologydescription : The tropical forests of Oceania are an enduring source of concern for indigenous communities, for the migrants who move to them, for the states that encompass them within their borders, for the multilateral institutions and aid agencies, and for the non-governmental organisations that focus on their conservation. Grounded in the perspective of political ecology, contributors to this volume approach forests as socially alive spaces produced by a confluence of local histories and global circulations. In doing so, they collectively explore the multiple ways in which these forests come into view and therefore into being. Exploring the local dynamics within and around these forests provides an insight into regional issues that have global resonance. Intertwined as they are with cosmological beliefs and livelihoods, as sites of biodiversity and Western desire, these forests have been and are still being transformed by the interaction of foreign and local entities. Focusing on case studies from Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Gambier Islands, this volume brings new perspectives on how Pacific Islanders continue to creatively engage with the various processes at play in and around their forests.

"title : Multiculturalism and Integration - author : Michael Clynecategory : anthropologydescription : Multiculturalism has been the official policy of all Australian governments (Commonwealth and State) since the 1970s. It has recently been criticised, both in Australia and elsewhere. Integration has been suggested as a better term and policy. Critics suggest it is a reversion to assimilation. However integration has not been rigorously defined and may simply be another form of multiculturalism, which the authors believe to have been vital in sustaining social harmony.

"title : The Journey - author : K.C. Dascategory : anthropologydescription : K. C. Das is deservedly one of the most celebrated writers in India today. He writes primarily in Oriya, the language of his native state of Orissa, where he was born in 1924. A civil servant by profession, Das pursued a second career as a writer of stories, poems, and essays.  The stories in this collection take place in an urban setting. The characters are mainly middle class, making them more accessible to North American readers than other examples of contemporary Indian fiction. These are not simple stories. They are about “divides,” about gaps between realities and imagination. In complex shifts between direct dialogue, interior monologue, and interior or imagined dialogue, Das lovingly but mercilessly exposes his characters' thoughts, self-deceptions, and the games they play with each other. These are stories about human weaknesses, the fallibility of human relationships, and the strategies we adopt to cope with our failures. They are about coming to terms with unpleasant, sometimes shocking truths about ourselves and others.   Read more Read less"
"title : Death, Emotion and Childhood in Premodern Europe - author : Katie Barclaycategory : anthropologydescription : This book draws on original material and approaches from the developing fields of the history of emotions and childhood studies and brings together scholars from history, literature and cultural studies, to reappraise how the early modern world reacted to the deaths of children. Child death was the great equaliser of the early modern period, affecting people of all ages and conditions. It is well recognised that the deaths of children struck at the heart of early modern families, yet less known is the variety of ways that not only parents, but siblings, communities and even nations, responded to childhood death. The contributors to this volume ask what emotional responses to child death tell us about childhood and the place of children in society. Placing children and their voices at the heart of this investigation, they track how emotional norms, values, and practices shifted across the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries through different religious, legal and national traditions. This collection demonstrates that child death was not just a family matter, but integral to how communities and societies defined themselves.

"title : Global processes of flight and migration = Globale Flucht- und Migrationsprozesse - author : Eva Bahlcategory : anthropologydescription : The case studies in this volume illustrate the global dimension of flight and migration movements with a special focus on South-South migration. Thirteen chapters shed light on transcontinental or regional migration processes, as well as on long-term processes of arrival and questions of belonging. Flight and migration are social phenomena. They are embedded in individual, familial and collective histories on the level of nation states, regions, cities or we-groups. They are also closely tied up with changing border regimes and migration policies. The explanatory power of case studies stems from analyzing these complex interrelations. Case studies allow us to look at both “common” and “rare” migration phenomena, and to make systematic comparisons. On the basis of in-depth fieldwork, the authors in this volume challenge dichotomous distinctions between flight and migration, look at changing perspectives during processes of migration, consider those who stay, and counter political and media discourses which assume that Europe, or the Global North in general, is the pivot of international migration.

"title : Vergessen und verloren - author : Bernhard Führercategory : anthropologydescription : Lost and Forgotten presents an historical overview of one regional development of Chinese studies / Sinology from the seventeenth century to the present time. The book focuses on the description and evaluation of contributions by scholars who originated from Austria and the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.    Contributions that were made in Austria and achievements of emigrants are treated in separate chapters. The account of the development of Chinese studies from the time when Sinology was institutionalised at Vienna University (1972) deals with the institutions involved.    Apart from published material, the author also includes a wealth of unpublished research work found in libraries and archives in Austria, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The book incorporates detailed investigations of the source material, descriptions of state-of-the-art research at the time, and a discussion of these contributions in the light of the international Sinological discourse past and present. Book reviews, personal correspondence, discussion of personal affiliations and feuds offer further insights into the intellectual background of these scholars, their aims, concerns and methodological approaches.  Diese Darstellung der Geschichte der österreichischen Chinastudien beschreibt die Beiträge in Österreich wirkender und aus Österreich stammender Chinawissenschaftler aus der Sicht der internationalen Entwicklung des Faches von den Anfängen im 16. Jahrhundert bis zur Gegenwart.  Die Darstellungsweise ist in vier Hauptperioden gegliedert. Die Beiträge der in Österreich tätigen Wissenschaftler und der Emigranten und Auswanderer werden in getrennten Kapiteln diskutiert. Die Beschreibung der Chinastudien in Österreich seit der universitären Institutionalisierung des Faches im Jahr 1972 ist institutionsgeschichtlich angelegt.  Das Hauptinteresse dieser Studie liegt in den fachspezifischen Publikationen, deren Rolle und Einschätzung im Rahmen der internationalen Entwicklung der Chinastudien. Vom wissenschaftlichen Werk der einzelnen Forscher ausgehend, wurden ihre Quellen lokalislert und the oftmals durchaus kontroversen Diskussionen, die ihre Beiträge hervorriefen, analysiert. Neben den Forschungsergebnissen standen methodisches Vorgehen und die Quellenlage, welche die einzelnen Beiträge prägten, im Zentrum der Darstellung. Der Einbettung der Forscher in die internationalen Chinawissenschaften und ihren Verbindungenslinien wurde dabei besonderes Augemnerk gewidmet.  Im Rahmen dieser Studie wurden zahlreiche bisher unbearbeitete und teils auch unbekannte Nachlässe gesichtet und eingearbeitet. Neben der Großzahl, der heute in erster Linie aus fachgeschichtlicher Sicht interessanten Arbeit konnte manche in Vergessenheit geratene und bis heute relevante Schrift ausfindig gemacht werden.  Auch wenn der aus Österreich stammende Beitrag zur internationalen Entwicklung des Faches als eher bescheiden einzustufen ist, so konnten im Rahmen dieser Studie, einige kleine Beiträge eruiert werden, in denen seinerzeitige wissenschaftliche Ansätze und Methoden aus anderen Fächern in der Sinologie Anwendung fanden. Diese Beiträge wurden sowohl im wissenschaftsgeschichtlichen Kontext ihrer Entstehungszeit als auch aus heutiger Sicht diskutiert.  Eine kritische Positionierung der Arbeiten der in Österreich tätigen und der aus Österreich stammenden Wissenschaftler innerhalb der deutschsprachigen Chinawissenschaften und Sinologie hatte bisher nicht stattgefunden. Diese in London entstandene Studie geht über die Entwicklung in den deutschsprachigen Ländern weit hinaus. Sie zeigt auf, welch enormes Potential für eine positivere Entwicklung der Chinawissenschaften und der Sinologie Österreich und danit der gesamten deutschsprachigen Entwicklung verloren ging.  Mit Vergessen und verloren wird die bisher umfangreichste und detaillierteste Monographie über eine nationale Entwicklung der Chinawissenschaften in Europa vorgelegt.   Read more Read less"

It should be recognized that these essays appear in revised lecture form, and not as fully polished scholarly papers. They carry nevertheless the authority—and no little verve—of experienced scholars concerned with both the traditions and the changes so characteristic of modern India. [v]   Read more Read less"
"title : The European Second Generation Compared - author : Frans Leliecategory : anthropologydescription : Integration of newcomers is a foremost challenge for contemporary Europe. The 'second generation' - children born of immigrant parentage - is crucial in this process, for they constitute a growing and increasingly vocal segment of the metropolitan youth. This book offers an unprecedented look at the real-life place and position of the European second generation in education, labour, social relations, religion and identity formation. Using data collected by the TIES survey in fifteen cities across eight European countries, the authors paint a vivid picture of how the children of immigrants from Turkey, Morocco and former Yugoslavia are progressing. Their findings and cross-national comparisons are demographically compelling and at times revelational.  De kinderen van nieuwkomers in Europa vormen een snel groeiende en vaak opvallende groep jongeren, maar toch is er nauwelijks vergelijkend onderzoek naar gedaan. Voor dit boek werd op grote schaal informatie verzameld op het gebied van onderwijs, werk, sociale relaties, religie en identiteitsvorming. Daardoor ontstaat een helder beeld van de positie van de kinderen van immigranten uit Turkije, Marokko en voormalig Joegoslavië in 15 Europese steden. Een vergelijking tussen deze steden biedt daarbij inzicht in de sterke en zwakke punten van sociaal en integratiebeleid.   Read more Read less"
"title : Social Organization in South China, 1911–1949 - author : Yuen-fong Wooncategory : anthropologydescription : Bridging the collapse of the Confucian state and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, the period 1911–49 is particularly fascinating to historians, anthropologists, sociologists and political scientists. Unfortunately, it is also a very confusing period, full of shifts and changes in economic, social, and political organizations. The social implications of these changes, and the relationships between officials on the subdistrict level, the unofficial leaders, and the bulk of the peasantry remain inadequately known. South China, which nurtured the Communist Party in its formative years, is a particularly interesting case. In this study I use the Kuan lineage of K’ai-p’ing as a case study to show the effects of demographic, economic, administrative, and educational changes after the Treaty of Nanking (1842) on patrilineal kinship as a principle of social organization in South China.

"title : Classifying the Zhuangzi Chapters - author : Xiaogan Liucategory : anthropologydescription : The relationships, both historical and philosophical, among the Zhuangzi’s Inner, Outer, and Miscellaneous chapters are the subject of ancient and enduring controversy. Liu marshals linguistic, intertextual, intratextual, and historical evidence to establish an objectively demonstrable chronology and determine the philosophical affiliations among the various chapters. This major advance in Zhuangzi scholarship furnishes indispensable data for all students of the great Daoist text. In a lengthy afterword, Liu compares his conclusions with those of A. C. Graham and addresses the relationship between the Zhuangzi and the Laozi.   Read more Read less"

"title : Mutualist Microfinance - author : Abram Swaan decategory : anthropologydescription : Small mutual funds once flourished in nineteenth century Europe and North America. They still abound in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In recent years they have come back to European and North American cities with the immigrants from the global South. Some of the small mutual savings funds use the accumulated sums to provide financial assistance to members in distress and thus fulfil an insurance function. Others make loans regardless of their members' individual needs, in which case it is the savings or credit function that predominates. In this volume, five authors describe and analyse the results of their fieldwork among mutual fund members in Hyderabad, Yogyakarta, Ayelitsa (a township near Cape Town), among Surinamese in both Paramaribo (Suriname) and Amsterdam, as well as among Senegalese Peul who migrate from Thilonge to Dakar and on to Paris. The studies are based on field observations and personal interviews. The two editors, Abram de Swaan and Marcel van der Linden, provide a common comparative approach, and a shared historical and theoretical perspective. The essays explore the varieties and the logic of mutual funds, emphasizing the importance of peer pressures as a 'social constraint' to increase 'self constraint' on spending. Cooperation in a mutual fund, whether for insurance or saving purposes, can proffer the participants advantages which they cannot realize on their own.   Read more Read less"

"title : A Translation of Lao-tzu’s Tao Te Ching and Wang Pi’s Commentary - author : Paul J. Lincategory : anthropologydescription : During the Spring-Autumn period (722–420 BCE) and the time of the Warring States (480–222 CE), China was in great turmoil. Intellectuals and social reformers sifted through their wisdom and knowledge of China’s experiences up to then, attempting to find a solution to their situation.  The Tao Te Ching, one of the foremost products of the era, is a metaphysical book, a source of the highest political thought. Many readers have found in it representations of the highest ideals of human endeavors. Yet given its likely oral origin and the technological limitations of its early textual transmission, the Tao Te Ching raises numerous questions related to authorship, date of origin, internal organization, textual coherence, and editorial history.  Of the scores of translations of the Tao Te Ching, the great majority are based on the edition prepared by the third-century scholar Wang Pi. Wang’s profound commentary is itself a deeply influential text in the development of Taoist thought. Paul Lin presents the commentary, otherwise unavailable in English, in the form of footnotes accompanying his meticulous rendition of the Taoist classic.   Read more Read less"
"title : Introduction to Old Javanese Language and Literature - author : Mary S. Zurbuchencategory : anthropologydescription : The oldest and most extensive written language of Southeast Asia is Old Javanese, or Kawi. It is the oldest language in terms of written records, and the most extensive in the number and variety of its texts. Javanese literature has taken many forms. At various times, prose stories, sung poetry or other metrical types, chronicles, scientific, legal, and philosophical treatises, prayers, chants, songs, and folklore were all written down. Yet relatively few texts are available in English. The unstudied texts remaining are an unexplored record of Javanese culture as well as a language still alive as a literary medium in Bali.  Introduction to Old Javanese Language and Literature represents a first step toward remedying the dearth of Old Javanese texts available to English-speaking students. The ideal teaching companion, this anthology offers transliterated original texts with facing-page English translations. Theanthology focuses on prose selections, since their straightforward style and syntax offer the beginning student the most rewarding experience. Four sections make up the collection. Part I offers several short readings as the most accessible entry point into Old Javanese. Part II contains two moralistic fables from an Old Javanese retelling of the Hindu Pañcatantra cycle. Part III takes up the epic, providing excerpts from one of the books of the Old Javanese retelling of the Mahabharata. Part IV offers excerpts from two chronicles, the generic conventions of which challenge received notions of history writing because of their supernaturalism and folkloric elements.  Includes introduction, glossary, and notes.   Read more Read less"

"title : Paninian Studies - author : Madhav Deshpandecategory : anthropologydescription : Pa?ini’s grammar is the oldest surviving grammar of Sanskrit, dating back to the fifth century BCE. In its completeness of coverage of linguistic elements and its theoretical and analytical sophistication, Pa?ini’s grammar is surprisingly modern. It has long provided inspiration for many ideas in modern linguistics, and continues to attract scholars’ attention in the fields of Sanskrit and linguistics.  Pa?inian Studies collects seventeen essays on Pa?inian linguistics in a single volume dedicated to Professor S. D. Joshi, a stalwart scholar of Pa?inian grammar. The contributors, all scholors of international acclaim and students and friends of Professor Joshi, include Ashok Aklujkar, Pandit V. B. Bhagwat, Saroja Bhate, Gopikamohan Bhattacharya, Johannes Bronkhorst, George Cardona, Achyutananda Dash, Madhav M. Deshpande, Peter Edwin Hook, Daniel H. H. Ingalls, V. N. Jha, Dinabandhu Kar, Paul Kiparsky, Bimal Krishna Matilal, G. B. Palsule, K. Kunjunni Raja, and J. A. F. Roodbergen. Taken together, their contributions encompass the wide range of interests and specializations within the field of Pa?inian studies.   Read more Read less"
"title : Child Soldiers in Context - author : Artur Bognercategory : anthropologydescription : Long before “IS” and “Boko Haram”, the messianic “Lord’s Resistance Army” (LRA) in Uganda was considered as one of the most brutal rebel groups in Africa, or in the world, and as one which clearly specialized in the abduction, “recruitment” and deployment of children and adolescents as ombatants. This book presents the results of a research project on former child soldiers and rebels in northern Uganda and their “reintegration” into society after their return to civilian life. The authors investigate their biographies and the social figurations or relationships between them and members of the civilian population that emerged following their return, not least in their families of origin, and show which conditions facilitate or hinder their “(re)integration” into civilian life. The discussion also shows what distinguishes them from former members of rebel groups in the neighboring region of West Nile, in respect of their history and how they were recruited, as well as in their present situation and social position.

"title : Die Generation Oslo im Westjordanland - author : Hendrik Hinrichsencategory : anthropologydescription : The past fifty years have seen far-reaching changes in Palestinian society in the West Bank. The Israeli occupation which began in 1967, the political mobilization of the 1970s and 1980s, and the so-called peace process in the 1990s went together with deep social transformations, which not only changed the dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but also altered the figurations and conflict lines between different social groups within Palestinian society. This book is a sociological study of these transformation processes, based on a combination of Norbert Elias’ figurational sociology, social-constructivist biographical research, and Karl Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge and generational sociology. In addition to conflicts and tensions between inhabitants of the old refugee camps and the (new) urban middle class in the West Bank, the author focuses in particular on a latent Palestinian generational conflict: it is clear that members of the ‘Oslo Generation’ – meaning those who grew up during the Oslo peace process in the 1990s – have fewer power and life chances, and in particular fewer opportunities for meaning, than their predecessors in the generation of fighters and activists of the 1970s and 1980s.

"title : Doctoral Dissertations on South Asia, 1966–1970 - author : Frank J Shulmancategory : anthropologydescription : This volume gathers the harvest of recent doctoral dissertations on South Asia, principally from North America and Western Europe, but exclusive of theses from universities in South Asia itself. The yield—1305 dissertations based on research carried out during the early and middle nineteen-sixties and brought to completion between 1966 and 1970—is even greater than one would have guessed, eloquent testimony to the expansion of South Asian studies in the West over the last decade.  Doctoral Dissertations on South Asia seeks to be a comprehensive compilation of recently completed theses dealing in whole or in part with the former civilizations and the contemporary affairs of Ceylon, India, Nepal and Pakistan. At the same time, this work provides striking testimony of the dynamic growth of Asian Studies outside the subcontinent and particularly in the United States, Great Britain, Germany and France, where most of the major centers of scholarship are presently found. It is an interdisciplinary work covering the natural sciences as well as the humanities and social sciences.   Read more Read less"

"title : Legacies of Space and Intangible Heritage - author : Fernando Armstrong-Fumerocategory : archaeologydescription : This volume looks at how different physical environments contribute to the reproduction of cultural forms even in the wake of colonization, migration, and other processes of displacement and change. This raises the question of whether cultural practices are altered by changes in physical environment or if a group’s narratives and practices shape their location. Using case studies from North and South America, the contributors reveal a pattern of abandonment and reestablishment of settlements and how collective memory drives people back to culturally meaningful sites. Through the lenses of archaeology and ethnohistory and by examining the politics of cultural continuity, the authors argue that there is a complex relationship between a people’s heritage and the landscape that affects the making of “place.”   Read more Read less"

Philip's death while on safari soon after their wedding left Emily feeling little grief, for she barely knew the dashing stranger. But her discovery of his journals nearly two years later reveals a far different man than she imagined—a gentleman scholar and antiquities collector who apparently loved his new wife deeply. Emily's desire to learn more of her late husband leads her through the quiet corners of the British Museum and into a dangerous mystery involving rare stolen artifacts.  To complicate matters, she's juggling two very prominent and wealthy suitors, one of whose intentions may go beyond matrimony into darker realms . . .   Read more Read less"

"title : Excavating Jesus: Beneath the Stones, Behind the Texts - author : John Dominic Crossancategory : archaeologydescription : The premier historical Jesus scholar joins a brilliant archaeologist to illuminate the life and teaching of Jesus against the background of his world.There have been phenomenal advances in the historical understanding of Jesus and his world and times, but also huge, lesser known advances in first–century Palestine archaeology that explain a great deal about Jesus, his followers, and his teachings. This is the first book that combines the two and it does it in a fresh, accessible way that will interest both biblical scholars and students and also the thousands of lay readers of Biblical Archaeology Review (150,000+ circulation), National Geographic, and other archaeology and ancient history books and magazines. Each chapter of the book focuses on a major modern archaeological or textual discovery and shows how that discovery opens a window onto a major feature of Jesus's life and teachings.

Surely it is a waste for me to go back to England, while you stay here, when we might be together?""  Tula raised her head to look at him.  ""What are you... saying?"" she asked in a voice little above a whisper.  ""I am saying this,"" Lord Yelverton answered. He put his arms around her as he spoke and drew her close against him. Then his mouth was on hers. ""You are so beautiful, quite unlike anyone I have ever seen before,"" he said, ""and I want you --I want you desperately! You know as well as I do, that I cannot live without you.""

"title : The great journey: the peopling of ancient America - author : Brian M. Fagancategory : archaeologydescription : How, where, when, and why did human beings take the first steps in their journey to populate North America? First published in 1987, The Great Journey tells the story of the search for the first Americans--one of archaeology's great controversies. An enhanced edition of this dramatic narrative and real-life mystery follows the trail of evidence from the Old World to the New, beginning with an update on the debates and discoveries that have taken place since the late 1980s. Fagan presents the latest archaeological findings on both sides of the Bering Strait, new genetic and linguistic research that amplifies earlier theories, and he assesses the importance of global warming to first settlement.  The saga of how Asians came across the Bering Sea land bridge begins with the emergence of modern humans in tropical Africa some 150,000 years ago. Fagan describes the great Homo sapiens diaspora, which included the settlement of America, during the late Ice Age. He evaluates the various routes that brought Stone Age hunter-gatherers from Siberia into North America and beyond.  This magnificently readable book, widely regarded as a classic of archaeological writing, sets forth different scenarios for first settlement, the controversies over the extinction of large Ice Age animals, and a brief overview of cultural developments since the time of the Paleo-Indians. Lavishly illustrated with maps, photographs, and line drawings, the updated edition of The Great Journey offers an entertaining yet sober assessment of what we know about the first    Americans.  Brian M. Fagan is emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.   Read more Read less"

"title : Before the flood - author : Wilson, Iancategory : archaeologydescription : ""The great biblical flood described in Genesis has long been a subject of fascination and speculation. In the nineteenth century the English archbishop James Usher established it as having happened in the year 2348 B.C., calculating what was then taken as the age of the earth and working backward through the entire series of biblical ""begats."" Proof of the flood, which is an element of so many creation myths, began in earnest when archeology started connecting physical evidence with biblical story. The dream of proving the Bible to be literal truth has proven irresistible, producing both spurious claims and serious scholarship."" Exploring all the archeological evidence, Wilson explains how the Black Sea flood and the biblical flood have to be connected. In particular, Wilson argues that the center of the civilized world was farther to the west than previously thought - not in Egypt or Mesopotamia but in what is today northern Turkey. The earliest, antediluvian civilizations may have migrated east into those places we have come to call the cradles of civilization, forced by the Black Sea flood to create new settlements.

"title : Revolutionizing a world - author : Mark Altaweelcategory : archaeologydescription : This book investigates the long-term continuity of large-scale states and empires, and its effect on the Near East’s social fabric, including the fundamental changes that occurred to major social institutions. Its geographical coverage spans, from east to west, modern-day Libya and Egypt to Central Asia, and from north to south, Anatolia to southern Arabia, incorporating modern-day Oman and Yemen. Its temporal coverage spans from the late eighth century BCE to the seventh century CE during the rise of Islam and collapse of the Sasanian Empire. The authors argue that the persistence of large states and empires starting in the eighth/seventh centuries BCE, which continued for many centuries, led to new socio-political structures and institutions emerging in the Near East. The primary processes that enabled this emergence were large-scale and long-distance movements, or population migrations. These patterns of social developments are analysed under different aspects: settlement patterns, urban structure, material culture, trade, governance, language spread and religion, all pointing at movement as the main catalyst for social change. This book’s argument is framed within a larger theoretical framework termed as ‘universalism’, a theory that explains many of the social transformations that happened to societies in the Near East, starting from the Neo-Assyrian period and continuing for centuries. Among other influences, the effects of these transformations are today manifested in modern languages, concepts of government, universal religions and monetized and globalized economies.

"title : THIRD TRANSLATION, THE - author : Matt Bondurantcategory : archaeologydescription : Walter Rothschild is an American Egyptologist living in London and charged by the British Museum with the task of unlocking the riddle of the Stela of Paser, one of the last and most important hieroglyphic mysteries in existence. Estranged from his wife and grown daughter, alone in the world except for his dead languages and dreams of ancient worlds, Rothschild becomes the dupe in a seduction, robbery, and developing conspiracy engineered by a cult devoted to ancient Egyptian mysticism. Aided as well as hindered by a group of highly idiosyncratic Londoners, Walter must force his middle-aged body to perform acts of heroics to defeat the plotters and take back what rightfully belongs to the museum—and most importantly to save his career. In the process, two friends will end up dead, and Walter will find himself allied with a young, distinctly English librarian who becomes as unlikely a heroine as Walter is a hero. Extensively researched and utterly original, the novel is told in electric prose that weaves together a novel of self-discovery and the inner yearnings of men, with a fast-paced plot about ancient mystery and modern conspiracy.

"title : The Hundred and Ninety-nine Steps - author : Michel Fabercategory : archaeologydescription : Tired of nightmares in which she meets a grisly end, Sian decides she needs to get out more, so she joins an archaeological dig at Whitby Abbey. What she finds is a mystery involving a long-hidden murder, a man with big hands and a fragile manuscript in a bottle. Faber's dazzling novella takes up the 199 steps in Whitby that link the 21st century with the ruins of the past. Equal and indissoluble parts thriller, romance, historical/ghost story and meditation on the nature of sincerity, this is an ingenious literary page-turner. The Hundred and Ninety-Nine Steps, like Henry James's The Turn of the Screw, deploys a masterful sense of ambiguity, works on many levels and, as always with Faber's writing, is elegant, thought-provoking, distinctive and compelling.

"title : The archaeology of human bones - author : Simon Mayscategory : archaeologydescription : There is no greater direct evidence regarding earlier human populations than their physical remains. This volume provides a pragmatic and up-to-date account of forensic analysis of human skeletal remains, and its application in tackling major historical and archaeological issues. The Archaeology of Human Bones starts with an introduction to the anatomy, structure and development of bones and teeth. It analyzes the biasing effects of decay and incomplete recovery on burial data from archaeological sites, and discusses what we may learn about ancient burial rituals from human remains. Subsequent chapters focus on the demographic analysis of ancient populations, normal skeletal variation, ancient disease and injury, the chemical analysis of bone, the study of DNA, and the study of cremated remains. Examples are brought from archaeological studies around the world. The Archaeology of Human Bones is a well-illustrated textbook for students of archaeology, explaining current scientific methods - technical jargon kept to a minimum - alongside critical discussion of their strengths and weaknesses.

"title : New Directions in Archaeological Science (TA28) - author : Andrew Fairbairncategory : archaeologydescription : Archaeological Science meetings will have a personality of their own depending on the focus of the host archaeological fraternity itself. The 8th Australasian Archaeometry meeting follows this pattern but underlying the regional emphasis is the continuing concern for the processes of change in the landscape that simultaneously effect and illuminate the archaeological record. These are universal themes for any archaeological research with the increasing employment of science-based studies proving to be a key to understanding the place of humans as subjects and agents of change over time. This collection of refereed papers covers the thematic fields of geoarchaeology, archaeobotany, materials analysis and chronometry, with particular emphasis on the first two. The editors Andrew Fairbairn, Sue O?Connor and Ben Marwick outline the special value of these contributions in the introduction. The international nature of archaeological science will mean that the advances set out in these papers will find a receptive audience among many archaeologists elsewhere. There is no doubt that the story that Australasian archaeology has to tell has been copiously enriched by incorporating a widening net of advanced science-based studies. This has brought attention to the nature of the environment as a human artefact, a fact now more widely appreciated, and archaeology deals with these artefacts, among others, in this way in this publication.

"title : Journeys into the Rainforest (Terra Australis 43) - author : Åsa Ferriercategory : archaeologydescription : This monograph presents the results of archaeological research that takes a longitudinal approach to interpreting and understanding Aboriginal–European contact. It focuses on a small but unique area of tropical rainforest in far north Queensland’s Wet Tropics Bioregion, located within the traditional lands of the Jirrbal Aboriginal people on the Evelyn Tableland. The research integrates a diverse range of data sources: archaeological evidence recovered from Aboriginal open sites occupied in the pre- to post-contact periods, historical documents of early ethnographers, settlers and explorers in the region, supplemented with Aboriginal oral history testimony. Analyses of the archaeological evidence excavated from three open sites facilitated the identification of the trajectories of culture change and continuity that this investigation focused on: Aboriginal rainforest material culture and technology, plant subsistence strategies, and rainforest settlement patterns. Analyses of the data sets demonstrate that initial use of the rainforest environment on the Evelyn Tableland occurred during the early Holocene period, with successful adaptation and a change towards more permanent Aboriginal use of the rainforest becoming established in the late Holocene period. European arrival and settlement on traditional Aboriginal land resulted in a period of historical upheaval for the Aboriginal rainforest people. Following an initial period of violent interactions and strong Aboriginal resistance from the rainforest, Jirrbal Aboriginal people continued to adapt and transform their traditional culture to accommodate for the many changes forced upon them throughout the post‑contact period.

"title : Die hellenistischen Reliefbecher aus Lousoi - author : Christine Roglcategory : archaeologydescription : The ancient city of Lousoi was located to west of the well known Artemis Hemera sanctuary, at the foot of Mount Ilias. In the year 1983 the Austrian Archaeological Institute (ÖAI) in Athens started with systematic excavations in two house-complexes which are situated on terraces within the urban area. In the cadastral maps this location is known as ""Phournoi"".    During the excavations, which continued till 1994, around 350 moldmade fragments with relief decoration from the hellenistic period were found. The moldmade bowls form the largest part of these finds. They were used as drinking vessels during the Greek symposion. Apart from larger bowls and a very small bowl (""miniature"") there are also relief-decorated craters, amphoras, jugs, funnels and two bowls of which one has a round stand and the other a high foot. A relief-plate of grey clay from Lousoi has already been published elsewhere. With these finds Lousoi offers a wide variety of moldmade relief-decorated pottery. The various vessels could be composed into complete sets.    A few bowls have been preserved almost intact, but the majority of the material is fragmentary in various degrees. For the moment the moldmade bowls are dated tentaively by comparing stamps, decoration-schemes and styles with other specimens, not by contexts, within the second and first half of the first century B.C.    There are several imported pieces (around 20%) which considerably differ from the regional and local products. This becomes obvious by comparing and analysing stamps, profiles, dimensions, fabrics and other ""individual"" peculiarities of the bowls. The local production shows various influences but also strong individual features. The quality of the local production varies from very high to rather mediocre. For the locally produced bowls the term ""Brown ware/Lousoi"" was chosen. A distinction is made between a series 1 and 2 based on the type of rosette-stamp in the bottom medaillon and the profile.    A peculiar feature of ancient Lousoi, which nowadays seems lost in the middle of nowhere, are its commercial relations. There are imports from Argos, a centre for moldmade pottery production on the Peloponnese, from the region around Corinth, Sikyon and from Egio. And there is also evidence for strong connections with more northern regions such as Phokis with parallel examples in Amphissa (compare also the honorary inscriptions on bronze from the propylon in the Artemis sanctuary which were found during the old Austrian excavations in the years 1898 - 1899).  In einer Einleitung werden sowohl Zielsetzung als auch materialimmante Grenzen abgesteckt. Danach erfolgt ein Einblick in den Fund- und Grabungsplatz Lousoi. Dabei werden neben der Lage Lousois in einem nordarkadischen Hochtal auch die historische Bedeutung des Artemis-Hemera-Heiligtums als Stammesheiligtum der Achäer angesprochen. Die Funde stelbst, die in der Arbeit behandelt werden, stammen aus zwei Hauskomplexen, die sich im Stadtareal von Lousoi auf zwei Terassen im sogenannten Bereich ""Phournoi"" westlich des Heiligtums befinden. Noch weiter westlich dürfte das öffentliche Zentrum der Stadt folgen, wie jüngste Grabungen zeigten.    Im Zuge der systematischen Grabungen der Athener Zweigstelle des Österreichischen Archäologischen Institutes in den Jahren 1983 - 1994 wurden in diesen Häusern um die 350 Reliefbecher bzw. Fragmente von Reliefgefäßen aufgedeckt. In einem ersten Hauptteil wird nun die allgemeine Bedeutung und Forschungsgeschichte der Gattung ""Hellenistische Reliefbecher"" als Leitform innerhalt der hellenistischen Keramik behandelt. Die hellenistischen Reliefbecher wurden mittels einer mit Einzelpunzen dekorierten Formschüssel (=Model) hergestellt. Sie fanden als bei dem für die griechische Kultur so typischen Symposion als Trinkgefäße Verwendung. Besonderer Wert wird dabei auf die Methodik zur Erschließung von sog. Atliers gelegt. Dies leitet zu den im Material von Lousoi festgestellten lokalen, regionalen und importierten Gruppen im eigentlichen Hauptteil über. Als Kriterien zur Definition von Werkstätten bzw. zur Unterscheidung von oder Zuweisung zu Gruppen werden neben den verwendeten Einzelstempeln auch Profilverläufe, Dimensionen, Scherbentypen und ""individuelle"" Merkmale an den Bechern herangezogen. Ausgehend von fünf Modelfragmenten werden die zehn lokal hergestellte Gruppen, zwei regionale sowie fünf importierte Gruppen geschieden, einige Einzelstücke entziehen sich einer Zuordnung. Auch sind im Material neben der Form des halbkugeligen Bechers reliefdekorierte Kratere, Krateriskoi, Amphoren, Trichterbecher sowie größere und kleinste Becher enthalten. Damit erweist sich das in einem Hochtal Nordarkadiens liegende Lousoi sowohl hinsichtlich des dort bekannten Gefäßrepertoires als auch in bezug auf die festgestellten Importstücke als äußerst fortschrittlich und offen (dies gilt auch für die Ausstattung der Häuser). Zu nennen sind Importe aus Argos, einem Zentrum der Reliefbecherherstellung auf der Peloponnes, aus der Gegend um Korinth und Sikyon sowie aus Aigion. Hervorzuheben sind die Beziehungen der Stadt Lousoi weiter nach Norden, über den Paträischen und Korinthischen Golf hinaus, z.B. in die Phokis.    Im Anschluss an diese Auswertung werden noch Hinweise auf weitere Funde, die eine lokale Produktion von Töpferwaren vor Ort belegen, angeführt; gleiches gilt für die makroskopischen Beschreibungen der einzelnen Scherbentypen und die dazugehörigen mineralogisch-petrographischen Analysen. Eine englische und eine griechische Zusammenfassung bilden den Abschluss der Arbeit.   Read more Read less"

"title : The Migration Period, Pre-Viking Age, and Viking Age in Estonia - author : Andres Tvauricategory : archaeologydescription : This book analyses the society, economy, settlement, and culture of the territory of present-day Estonia in the period of ca AD 450–1050. This period is known in the Estonian archaeological chronology as the Migration Period, the Pre-Viking Age, and the Viking Age. This was an era of rapid change, by the end of which traditional Estonian peasant culture as it is known until the 19th century had developed. Whereas in Western Europe written sources from the second half of the first millennium AD herald the arrival of the Middle Ages, there is an almost complete absence of written information about the prevailing conditions and events that took place in the area of present-day Estonia. There are only remains of the farms and fortresses of that time beneath the earth, as well as cemeteries, overgrown field baulks and clearance cairns, and the large amount of excavated ancient objects or fragments thereof. Many aspects of prehistoric life cannot be researched because the source material is not extant and there is no hope of finding it. Moreover, many phenomena of human life do not generate archaeological source material. Thus our overall understanding of the Estonian Middle Iron Age and the Viking Age is inevitably fragmentary and superficial.   Read more Read less"
"title : 4000 Years of Migration and Cultural Exchange - author : Peter S. Bellwoodcategory : archaeologydescription : The project reported on in this monograph has been concerned with the archaeology of the Batanes Islands, an archipelago that must have been settled quite early in the process of Austronesian dispersal from Taiwan southwards into the Philippines. A multi-phase archaeological sequence covering the past 4000 years for the islands of Itbayat, Batan, Sabtang and Siayan is presented, extending from the Neolithic to the final phase of Batanes prehistory, just prior to the late 17th century arrivals of foreign navigators such as Jirobei (Japan) and William Dampier (England), followed by the first Spanish missionaries. So far, no traces of preceramic settlement have been found in Batanes, but the archaeological sequence there from the Neolithic onwards, like that in the Cagayan Valley in northern Luzon, is now one of the best-established in the Philippines.

"title : Life on the Margins - author : Patrick Faulknercategory : archaeologydescription : The research presented here is primarily concerned with human-environment interactions on the tropical coast of northern Australia during the late Holocene. Based on the suggestion that significant change can occur within short time-frames as a direct result of interactive processes, the archaeological evidence from the Point Blane Peninsula, Blue Mud Bay, is used to address the issue of how much change and variability occurred in hunter-gatherer economic and social structures during the late Holocene in coastal northeastern Arnhem Land. The suggestion proposed here is that processes of environmental and climatic change resulted in changes in resource distribution and abundance, which in turn affected patterns of settlement and resource exploitation strategies, levels of mobility and, potentially, the size of foraging groups on the coast. The question of human behavioural variability over the last 3000 years in Blue Mud Bay has been addressed by examining issues of scale and resolution in archaeological interpretation, specifically the differential chronological and spatial patterning of shell midden and mound sites on the peninsula in conjunction with variability in molluscan resource exploitation. To this end, the biological and ecological characteristics of the dominant molluscan species is considered in detail, in combination with assessing the potential for human impact through predation. Investigating pre-contact coastal foraging behaviour via the archaeological record provides an opportunity for change to recognised in a number of ways. For example, a differential focus on resources, variations in group size and levels of mobility can all be identified. It has also been shown that human-environment interactions are non-linear or progressive, and that human behaviour during the late Holocene was both flexible and dynamic.   Read more Read less"
"title : Prehistoric Marine Resource Use in the Indo-Pacific Regions - author : Rintaro Onocategory : archaeologydescription : Although historic sources provide information on recent centuries, archaeology can contribute longer term understandings of pre-industrial marine exploitation in the Indo-Pacific region, providing valuable baseline data for evaluating contemporary ecological trends. This volume contains eleven papers which constitute a diverse but coherent collection on past and present marine resource use in the Indo-Pacific region, within a human-ecological perspective. The geographical focus extends from Eastern Asia, mainly Japan and Insular Southeast Asia (especially the Philippines) to the tropical Pacific (Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia) and outlying sites in coastal Tanzania (Indian Ocean) and coastal California (North Pacific). The volume is divided thematically and temporally into four parts: Part 1, Prehistoric and historic marine resource use in the Indo-Pacific Region; Part 2, Specific marine resource use in the Pacific and Asia; Part 3, Marine use and material culture in the Western Pacific; and Part 4, Modern marine use and resource management.

"title : Political Strategies in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica - author : Sarah Kurnickcategory : archaeologydescription : New data from a variety of well-known scholars in Mesoamerican archaeology reveal the creation, perpetuation, and contestation of politically authoritative relationships between rulers and subjects and between nobles and commoners. The contributions span the geographic breadth and temporal extent of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica—from Preclassic Oaxaca to the Classic Petén region of Guatemala to the Postclassic Michoacán—and the contributors weave together archaeological, epigraphic, and ethnohistoric data. Grappling with the questions of how those exercising authority convince others to follow and why individuals often choose to recognize and comply with authority, Political Strategies in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica discusses why the study of political authority is both timely and significant, reviews how scholars have historically understood the operation of political authority, and proposes a new analytical framework to understand how rulers rule.

"title : 3D Recording and Interpretation for Maritime Archaeology - author : John K. McCarthycategory : archaeologydescription : This open access peer-reviewed volume was inspired by the UNESCO UNITWIN Network for Underwater Archaeology International Workshop held at Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia in November 2016. Content is based on, but not limited to, the work presented at the workshop which was dedicated to 3D recording and interpretation for maritime archaeology. The volume consists of contributions from leading international experts as well as up-and-coming early career researchers from around the globe. The content of the book includes recording and analysis of maritime archaeology through emerging technologies, including both practical and theoretical contributions. Topics include photogrammetric recording, laser scanning, marine geophysical 3D survey techniques, virtual reality, 3D modelling and reconstruction, data integration and Geographic Information Systems. The principal incentive for this publication is the ongoing rapid shift in the methodologies of maritime archaeology within recent years and a marked increase in the use of 3D and digital approaches. This convergence of digital technologies such as underwater photography and photogrammetry, 3D sonar, 3D virtual reality, and 3D printing has highlighted a pressing need for these new methodologies to be considered together, both in terms of defining the state-of-the-art and for consideration of future directions. As a scholarly publication, the audience for the book includes students and researchers, as well as professionals working in various aspects of archaeology, heritage management, education, museums, and public policy. It will be of special interest to those working in the field of coastal cultural resource management and underwater archaeology but will also be of broader interest to anyone interested in archaeology and to those in other disciplines who are now engaging with 3D recording and visualization.

"title : Egyptian Mummies and Modern Science - author : Rosalie Ann Davidcategory : archaeologydescription : Egyptian mummies have always aroused popular and scientific interest; however, most modern studies, although significantly increased in number and range, have been published in specialist journals. Now, this unique book, written by a long-established team of scientists, brings this exciting, cross-disciplinary area of research to a wider readership. It shows how this team's multidisciplinary, investigative methods and the unique resource of the Egyptian Mummy Tissue Bank are being used for the new major international investigations of disease evolution and ancient Egyptian pharmacy and pharmacology. It also assesses the current status of palaeopathology and ancient DNA research, and treatments available for conserving mummified remains. Descriptions of the historical development of Egyptian mummifications and medicine and detailed references to previous scientific investigations provide the context for firsthand accounts of cutting-edge research by prominent specialists in this field, demonstrating how these techniques can contribute to a new perspective on Egyptology.

"title : Archaeology of Aboriginal Australia - author : Tim Murraycategory : archaeologydescription : Presents an overview of the key issues in contemporary Australian archaeology.During the past thirty years the human history of the Australian continent has become the object of intense national and international interest. These years have been the 'decades of discovery', featuring fieldwork and analyses which have rewritten the distant past of Australia almost on a yearly basis. One measure of the international significance of these discoveries is the listing of three great archaeological provinces (Kakadu, Lake Mungo, and South West Tasmania) on the World Heritage Register.The Archaeology of Aboriginal Australia seeks to convey a sense of the excitement and significance of the research undertaken during the 'decades of discovery'. The material presented here-specially commissioned essays and key published articles by new and established scholars-focuses on the themes and issues which continue to attract the most attention among archaeologists: the antiquity of the human settlement of Australia patterns of colonisation the significance of change in Aboriginal society in the late prehistoric period the usefulness of reconstructions of past ecological systems in understanding thehistories of Aboriginal societies the value of rock art and stone tool technology in understanding the human historyof Australia the archaeology of Aboriginal-European contactAn overview chapter discusses changes in the practice of Australian archaeology (and the political context in which it is undertaken) during the last two decades. The Archaeology of Aboriginal Australia also conveys the fact that there is by no means a 'party line' among practitioners about how to understand more than 40,000 years of human action.

"title : Archaeologists in print - author : Amara Thorntoncategory : archaeologydescription : Archaeologists in Print is a history of popular publishing in archaeology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a pivotal period of expansion and development in both archaeology and publishing. It examines how British archaeologists produced books and popular periodical articles for a non-scholarly audience, and explores the rise in archaeologists? public visibility. Notably, it analyses women?s experiences in archaeology alongside better known male contemporaries as shown in their books and archives. In the background of this narrative is the history of Britain?s imperial expansion and contraction, and the evolution of modern tourism in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. Archaeologists exploited these factors to gain public and financial support and interest, and build and maintain a reading public for their work, supported by the seasonal nature of excavation and tourism. Reinforcing these publishing activities through personal appearances in the lecture hall, exhibition space and site tour, and in new media ? film, radio and television ? archaeologists shaped public understanding of archaeology. It was spadework, scripted.   Read more Read less"
"title : Origins of agriculture in western central Asia - author : David R. Harriscategory : archaeologydescription : In Origins of Agriculture in Western Central Asia, archaeologist David R. Harris addresses questions of when, how, and why agriculture and settled village life began east of the Caspian Sea. The book describes and assesses evidence from archaeological investigations in Turkmenistan and adjacent parts of Iran, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan in relation to present and past environmental conditions and genetic and archaeological data on the ancestry of the crops and domestic animals of the Neolithic period. It includes accounts of previous research on the prehistoric archaeology of the region and reports the results of a recent environmental-archaeological project undertaken by British, Russian, and Turkmen archaeologists in Turkmenistan, principally at the early Neolithic site of Jeitun (Djeitun) on the southern edge of the Karakum desert.  This project has demonstrated unequivocally that agropastoralists who cultivated barley and wheat, raised goats and sheep, hunted wild animals, made stone tools and pottery, and lived in small mudbrick settlements were present in southern Turkmenistan by 7,000 years ago (c. 6,000 BCE calibrated), where they came into contact with hunter-gatherers of the ""Keltiminar Culture."" It is possible that barley and goats were domesticated locally, but the available archaeological and genetic evidence leads to the conclusion that all or most of the elements of the Neolithic ""Jeitun Culture"" spread to the region from farther west by a process of demic or cultural diffusion that broadly parallels the spread of Neolithic agropastoralism from southwest Asia into Europe.  By synthesizing for the first time what is currently known about the origins of agriculture in a large part of Central Asia, between the more fully investigated regions of southwest Asia and China, this book makes a unique contribution to the worldwide literature on transitions from hunting and gathering to agriculture.

"title : The Dunlap farmstead - author : David Marvyn Stotherscategory : archaeologydescription : Archaeological and historical investigations of 33Wo41 revealed an antebellum rural farmstead (1831-1839) in Middleton Township, Wood County, Ohio. Excavations of a cabin structure and recovery of a rich, material culture provide a glimpse of frontier life in the Maumee Valley of Ohio during the 1830s. The farmstead is an archaeological expression of rural poverty and farm failure. The location of a small, family grave site nearby and historical documents indicate the farmstead was the residence of the Robert Dunlap (1752-1831), a former Revolutionary War soldier, and family. Historical investigations trace the history of Robert Dunlap and his family in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio.

"title : Lihir Destiny - author : Nicholas A. Baintoncategory : anthropologydescription : The people of the Lihir Islands in Papua New Guinea have long held visions of a prosperous new future, often referred to by local leaders as the ‘Lihir Destiny’. When large-scale gold mining activities commenced on the main island of Lihir in 1995, many hoped that this new world had finally arrived. The Lihir Destiny provides a nuanced account of the social structural and cultural transformations engendered by large-scale resource extraction. Tracing the history of Lihirian engagement with outside forces, from the colonial period through to recent mining activities, this book brings new light to bear on the bigger question of what ‘development’ means in contemporary Melanesia. The Lihir Destiny explores how Lihirian leaders devised future plans for a cultural revolution based upon the maximisation of mining activities and the influential philosophies of the Personal Viability movement. However, reaching the ‘Lihir Destiny’ is no simple affair, and many Lihirians find themselves negotiating divergent formulations of culture, sociality and economic engagement. The Lihir Destiny will appeal to readers interested in the social impacts of large-scale resource development, the processes of cultural continuity and change and the ways in which modernity is configured in local terms.

"title : Gunnar Landtman in Papua - author : David Lawrencecategory : anthropologydescription : Despite poverty and neglect the coastal Kiwai of the northern Torres Strait and Fly estuary are a strong and vibrant people with a long tradition of work in the marine industries of the Torres Strait. Regrettably their current social, economic and political problems are marginal to both Papua New Guinea and Australia. Gunnar Landtman’s research, undertaken between 1910 and 1912, is still a foundation stone for understanding the position of the Kiwai today. In those two years in Papua, Landtman managed to record a large collection of valuable legends and stories, many of which are still told today. He travelled widely throughout the Torres Strait, the southwest coast of Papua and the Fly estuary and even to the Gulf District. He made a comprehensive collection of Kiwai material culture now housed in the Museum of Cultures in Helsinki and a second, duplicate set for the Cambridge Museum. He also collected some of the earliest examples of Gogodala material culture available for research. In 1913, he published, Nya Guinea färden [New Guinea expedition], a detailed travelogue of his work and life among the Kiwai and, while he wrote a substantial corpus of work on the Kiwai in English, Swedish and Finnish over the next twenty years, this personal account in Swedish has not been translated into English before. It forms a crucial link between Landtman’s serious academic works and his intimate personal journey of discovery. The aim of this book is to bring the personal face of the serious anthropologist to greater attention. David Lawrence began studying the Gunnar Landtman collections held by the National Museum of Finland when he was researching customary exchange across the Torres Strait for his doctorate at James Cook University. He was also fortunate to be able to spend two years of fieldwork in the Fly estuary region and visited nearly all the communities described by Landtman. He is a Visiting Fellow at the Resource Management in Asia/Pacific program of The Australian National University and has published works on Kakadu National Park and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

"title : Customary Land Tenure and Registration in Australia - author : James Weinercategory : anthropologydescription : The main theme of this volume is a discussion of the ways in which legal mechanisms, such as the Land Groups Incorporation Act (1974) in PNG, and the Native Title Act (1993) in Australia, do not, as they purport, serve merely to identify and register already-existing customary indigenous landowning groups in these countries. Because the legislation is an integral part of the way in which indigenous people are defined and managed in relation to the State, it serves to elicit particular responses in landowner organisation and self-identification on the part of indigenous people. These pieces of legislation actively contour the progressive evolution of landowner social, territorial and political organisation at all levels in these nation states. The contributors to this volume provide in-depth anthropological case studies of social structural and cultural transformations engendered by the confrontation between states, developers and indigenous communities over rights to customarily owned land.

The American–Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land was front-page news at the time, but 60 years later it is virtually unknown. This lapse into obscurity was due partly to the fraught politics of Australian anthropology and animus towards its leader, the Adelaide-based writer-photographer Charles Mountford. Promoted as a ‘friendly mission’ that would foster good relations between Australia and its most powerful wartime ally, the Expedition was sponsored by National Geographic, the Smithsonian Institution and the Australian Government. An unlikely cocktail of science, diplomacy and popular geography, the Arnhem Land Expedition put the Aboriginal cultures of the vast Arnhem Land reserve on an international stage.

"title : Scholars at War - author : Geoffrey Graycategory : anthropologydescription : Scholars at War is the first scholarly publication to examine the effect World War II had on the careers of Australasian social scientists. It links a group of scholars through geography, transnational, national and personal scholarly networks, and shared intellectual traditions, explores their use, and contextualizes their experiences and contributions within wider examinations of the role of intellectuals in war. Scholars at War is structured around historical portraits of individual Australasian social scientists. They are not a tight group; rather a cohort of scholars serendipitously involved in and affected by war who share a point of origin. Analyzing practitioners of the social sciences during war brings to the fore specific networks, beliefs and institutions that transcend politically defined spaces. Individual lives help us to make sense of the historical process, helping us illuminate particular events and the larger cultural, social and even political processes of a moment in time.  Contributors include Peter Hempenstall, JD Legge, Jock Phillips, John Pomeroy, Cassandra Pybus, David Wetherell, Janet Wilson.   Read more Read less"
"title : Man Bac - author : Marc F. Oxenhamcategory : anthropologydescription : The site of Man Bac in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, one of the most meticulously excavated and carefully analysed of Southeast Asian archaeological sites in the past few years, is emerging as a key site in the region. This book carefully analyses the human and animal remains and puts them into context. The authors describe in detail the health status, the unusual demographic profile and the interestingly divergent affinities of the cemetery population, and discuss their meaning, particularly in association with evidence for the use of marine and terrestrial animal resources; they argue convincingly that the site documents a time when the face of the region’s population was undergoing a fundamental shift, associated with a changing economic subsistence base. Physical anthropologists and archaeologists have argued for years over the timeline, the manner and the very nature of Southeast Asian population history, and this book is essential reading in this debate. Two supporting appendices describe the individual remains in detail.   Read more Read less"
"title : What Good Condition? - author : Peter Readcategory : anthropologydescription : What Good Condition? collects edited papers, initially delivered at the Treaty Advancing Reconciliation conference, on the proposal for a treaty between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, a proposal which has been discussed and dissected for nearly 30 years. Featuring contributions from prominent Aboriginal community leaders, legal experts and academics, this capacious work provides an overview of the context and legacy of the residue of treaty proposals and negotiations in past decades; a consideration of the implications of treaty in an Indigenous, national and international context; and, finally, some reflections on regional aspirations and achievements.

"title : Aboriginal Placenames - author : Harold Kochcategory : anthropologydescription : Aboriginal approaches to the naming of places across Australia differ radically from the official introduced Anglo-Australian system. However, many of these earlier names have been incorporated into contemporary nomenclature, with considerable reinterpretations of their function and form. Recently, state jurisdictions have encouraged the adoption of a greater number of Indigenous names, sometimes alongside the accepted Anglo-Australian terms, around Sydney Harbour, for example. In some cases, the use of an introduced name, such as Gove, has been contested by local Indigenous people. The 19 studies brought together in this book present an overview of current issues involving Indigenous placenames across the whole of Australia, drawing on the disciplines of geography, linguistics, history, and anthropology. They include meticulous studies of historical records, and perspectives stemming from contemporary Indigenous communities. The book includes a wealth of documentary information on some 400 specific placenames, including those of Sydney Harbour, the Blue Mountains, Canberra, western Victoria, the Lake Eyre district, the Victoria River District, and southwestern Cape York Peninsula.

"title : Ethnographica Moralia - author : Neni Panourgiacategory : anthropologydescription : Panourgia and Marcus bring together anthropologists working in various parts of the world (Greece, Bali, Taiwan, the United States) with classicists, historians, and scholars in cultural studies. The volume takes into account global realities such as 9/11 and the opening of the Cypriot Green Line and explores the different ways in which Geertz’s anthropology has shaped the pedagogy of their disciplines and enabled discussions among them. Focusing on place and time, locations and temporalities, the essays in this volume interrogate the fixity of interpretation and open new spaces of inquiry. The volume addresses a wide audience from the humanities and the social sciences—anyone interested in the development of a new humanism that will relocate the human as a subject of social action.

"title : Historische Anthropologie im südöstlichen Europa - author : Siegfried Grubercategory : anthropologydescription : The beginnings of historical anthropology as a transdisciplinary project have to be located in the 1970s. However, in this part of the world it is still considered as a young project. This seems to be the main reason for not having yet developed a common understanding about its aims, methods and core contents. There is also no unanimity about the perception, advocated in this volume, that historical anthropology does not represent a new scientific discipline but an altered understanding of history as a discipline as a whole for the purpose of transdisciplinarity. The intention of the endeavor ‘historical anthropology’ is far from questioning established disciplines such as the historical scholarship but to put man in its historical contingency and cultural complexity into the focus of research and academic teaching. Since the temporal dimension does play a central role anthropologically oriented historical scholarship occupies a specific position in this project. Historical anthropology is comprehended here as integration of disciplines in the sense of a comprehensive science of the human being.    Historical anthropology conducted in a rather peripheral region such as Southeastern Europe or the Balkans due to its specific historic development and cultural features is confronted with partly other challenges and has partly different aims compared with Western or Central Europe, for instance, which is reflected in the composition of the present volume. It consists of five parts. The first one addresses migration and adaption strategies, the second one gender relations and stages of life. The third one deals with the complex relationship of geographic features such as mountains and sea, and the human being. The fourth part is devoted to law and disciplining, and the concluding one to identities. The authors are either directly affiliated with Centre for Southeast European History and Anthropology at University of Graz or colleagues from abroad with whom the Centre has intensive collaboration.  Die bislang vor allem ethnozentrierte Perspektive auf Geschichte und Kultur Südosteuropas hat viel zu den unübersehbaren Spannungen in der Region beigetragen. Eine historisch-anthropologische Perspektive kann dem Entscheidendes entgegensetzen und ethnozentrierte Blicke auflösen.  Dieser erste Überblick über Themenfelder einer Historischen Anthropologie im südostlichen Europa hat Einführungscharakter und weist gleichzeitig auf Forschungsperspektiven hin. Dargestellt werden u. a. folgende Themenfelder: Wanderungen und Anpassungsstrategien; Geschlechterbeziehungen und Lebensphasen; das Gebirge, die Stadt und das Meer; Recht und Disziplinierung; Identitäten. Die Beiträger und Beiträgerinnen stammen sowohl aus Ländern des westlichen als auch des südöstlichen Europa.   Read more Read less"
"title : ""Adieu ihr lieben Schwarzen"" - author : Clemens Gütlcategory : anthropologydescription : Franz Mayr was ""one of the most interesting of catholic missionaries in Southern Africa"" states Professor Joy Brain (""University of Durban"") in the foreword she wrote for this first edition of his writings. Mayr was born in the Austrian province of Tyrol in 1865, educated as a priest in the diocese of Brixen and arrived in Natal (South Africa) at the beginning of May 1890, inspired by the work being done there by the Trappist-Monks led by Abbot Franz Pfanner. Mayr was physically handicapped and soon left the trappists but just to offer his services to the vicar apostolic of Natal, Bishop Charles Jolivet, who accepted him for work among the African population. He was sent to Pietermaritzburg then capital of the British colony to take over the care of the African parishioners to bring the ""good news"" to those who had never heard it. He founded several new mission-stations in Natal, Southern Rhodesia (present day Zimbabwe) and Swaziland where he was killed by a native robber in 1914. Mayr - a man of many talents - was a gifted linguist, studied and published books in several African languages. He was interested in cultural anthropology and collected information about African customs. It is now more than a hundred years since Franz Mayr began his work of evangelisation and scholarship in Southern Africa. Publishing his letters and articles - kept by several archives in Europe - should help to remember a man of the Habsburg-Monarchy who went to preach the gospel to the so called heathen of Africa. Although Austria or Austria-Hungary never owned colonies in Africa many of its inhabitants left their homes to work in catholic mission-stations around the continent.     Several introductory chapters in this book explain the particular historical context which has to be put into consideration when reading Mayrs' writings. From there we learn about his life, his work, how he treated the native population, what he thought about other religious congregations around him, the colonialists and about troubles when trying to convince people to believe in the only - the ""European God"".     The missionary deserves to be better known. The present edition of historical sources is to be seen as a most relevant step allowing us to interpret his personality adequately.  Als ""einen der interessantesten katholischen Missionare im Südlichen Afrika"" bezeichnet die Historikerin Joy Brain den Tiroler Priester Franz Mayr in ihrem Vorwort zu dieser umfangreichen Quellenedition. Die gesammelten, aus zahlreichen Archiven im In- und Ausland stammenden Schriften Mayrs, umfassen Briefe, Tagebucheinträge, Auszüge aus Chroniken, seine in Missions- und ethnologischen Zeitschriften und Tageszeitungen erschienenen Artikel sowie zahlreiche zeitgenössische Photographien.     Obwohl unser Land bzw. die Habsburger-Monarchie selbst keine Kolonien auf diesem Kontinent besaß, wirkte doch eine beträchtliche Anzahl von ihnen u. a. in katholischen Stationen. Ihre Rolle in der Interaktion mit der einheimischen Bevölkerung und die Wirkung ihrer Missionsartikel auf das Afrikabild ist bisher nahezu unerforscht geblieben. Mayr war nur einer jener Österreicher und Österreicherinnen, die im Zuge der katholischen Missionseuphorie des 19. und beginnenden 20. Jahrhunderts ausreisten, um Afrikaner und Afrikanerinnen zum Christentum zu ""bekehren"". Er wurde 1865 in der Osttiroler Gemeinde Nussdorf geboren und verbrachte seine Gymnasialzeit in Brixen, wo er auch das Priesterseminar absolvierte. Ab 1890 wirkte er in der ehemaligen britischen Kolonie Natal (Südafrika), in Südrhodesien (heutiges Zimbabwe) und in Swaziland, wo er 1914 einem Mordanschlag zum Opfer fiel. Unter seiner Leitung entstanden mehrere Missionsstationen u. a. das Projekt ""Maryvale"", ein Dorf für die einheimischen katholischen Zulus, heute ein Stadtteil von Pietermaritzburg.     Über die vorhandenen Quellen erhält man Einblick in den Alltag des Missionars, Informationen über Hemmnisse seiner Arbeit und über Erfolgserlebnisse, seine Einstellung zur afrikanischen Bevölkerung, zur jeweiligen Kolonialregierung, zu anderen Religionsgemeinschaften oder über seinen persönlichen Gemütszustand. F. Mayr schrieb mehrere Bücher in afrikanischen Sprachen, hatte ein Faible für Musik und Photographie und sammelte leidenschaftlich ethnologische Gegenstände, die er teilweise afrikanischen Museen überließ, teilweise für Ausstellungen nach Europa sandte. Erst kürzlich entdeckte man im Herbarium der ""Universität von Natal"" eine Pflanzensammlung, die er angelegt hatte. Sie wird derzeit von einer Gruppe von Wissenschaftlern ausgewertet und stellt eine der frühesten Dokumentationen über den Gebrauch von Heilpflanzen der Zulus dar. Fast neunzig Jahre nach seinem Tod scheint nun also das Interesse am Leben des Österreichers zuzunehmen.    Der wichtigste Schritt für die wissenschaftliche Bearbeitung seiner Biographie ist mit der vorliegenden Herausgabe seiner Schriften getan. Völlig in Vergessenheit geraten, soll durch die chronologisch angeordnete Herausgabe dieser Dokumente Mayrs Leben und Werk in Erinnerung gerufen werden. Zu ihrer Interpretierbarkeit bzw. zum besseren Verständnis sind den einzelnen Abschnitten Kapitel zum historischen Kontext vorangestellt.   Read more Read less"
"title : Zeitgenössische Kunst aus Afrika - author : Thomas Fillitzcategory : anthropologydescription : Contemporary art of Africa reached a wider audience in the aftermath of the Magiciens de la Terre exhibition (Paris 1989). This study of fourteen artists from Ivory Coast and Benin is based on ethnographic fieldwork in both countries (1997), during which I worked with several artists. In order to consider the reception of contemporary art of Africa in the European/North American art world, researches in London, Paris, and New York followed (1997, 1998).     In Ivory Coast, I focused on a group of academically trained artists who belong to the Vohou Vohou movement which started in the early 1980s, and reached prominence in the 1990s. In Benin, I worked with artists who were not academically trained. One needs, however, to differentiate, as some had training as traditional artists, like the iron sculptures Calixte and Théodore Dakpogan, and adapted in the early 1990s their acquired skills to the creation of contemporary sculptures. Others, like Romuald Hazoumè and Georges Adéagbo, are self-trained. But they too interact with academically trained artists during residencies in various, West African or European countries.    In the major part of the volume, I am presenting the artists: which materials they are working with, what are their stylistic characteristics, which ideas and reflections are informing their work. In a following chapter, I try to trace the artists’ trajectories, the connections they are using in their work, be it to traditional stylistic canons, materials, techniques, and concepts, or to European modernism. In doing so, I adopt a situated perspective from these local art worlds (Abidjan and Cotonou/Porto Novo), in order to show the complexity of these creative artistic practices.    Other chapters of the volume deal with the notions of the art world (Becker’s sociological one and Danto’s cognitive). From an anthropological viewpoint I argue for a combination of both notions. Becker’s is important as to show the social, cultural, and economic aspects of the local art world. These aspects concern what is possible, or what is restricting the artistic endeavour. Danto’s concept needs an adaptation, in as far as it is not an embedding of the works of these artists within the grand narrative of Occidental art history. Rather, the notion is used in the plural, as the focus is on local, regional, and transcultural connections of artistic practices. I thereafter argue against a universalising, hegemonic narrative of the European/North American art world.    The other notion, which is discussed in the volume, is the one of ‘contemporary African art.’ Instead of analysing the notion from a theoretical perspective, I follow the artists, how they explain their art and its possible African character. This approach shows a wide continuum between a clear African dimension and one that considers contemporary art practices as encompassing without any regional specification.    The final chapter deals with reflections about a modern, contemporary anthropology of art. Such an anthropology does not restrict itself to the study of ethnic arts but considers all art as its subject. In particular, it has to deal with contemporary art in its present, multiple expressions on the basis of ethnographic fieldwork. It may participate in wider discussions about global art (although the notion is not dealt with in the volume), from locally situated gazes.    Context is a major topic in that respect. While former studies in the anthropology of art contextualised works of art by considering their functions and meanings, context is here as well considered as related to artistic practices, the connections to other skills, techniques, materials, styles, or ideas which are visualised in the work of art.    I would like to express my gratitude to the ‘Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung’ (FWF) which enabled the fieldworks, archival researches, and the publication of the present volume.  Seit dem Ende der achtziger Jahre ist zeitgenössische Kunst aus Afrika von Großausstellungen in Europa und Amerika kaum mehr wegzudenken. Dennoch ist heute noch immer wenig über Künstler von diesem Kontinent zu erfahren. Basierend auf einem mehrmonatigen Aufenthalt und intensiven Recherchen, stellt der Autor 14 Gegenwartskünstler aus Cote d""Ivoire und Benin vor. Dabei werden ihre Werke anhand von Gesprächsausschnitten und der Erklärungen ihrer Konzepte und überlegungen erläutert. Auf diesem Weg wird der Leser angeregt, sich eingehend mit diesen verschiedensten Ausdrucksformen - von Bildern über Skulpturen und Masken aus Abfallprodukten, bis hin zu Installationen - auseinanderszusetzen. Dabei wird ebenso auf die Ausbildungssituation eingegangen wie auf das Umfeld, die Kunstwelt, in der die Künstler leben und schöpferisch arbeiten. Die Studie gewährt nicht nur Einblick in unterschiedliches künstlerisches Schaffen in Afrika, sie zeigt ebenso die Lebenswelten der Künstler, deren Kenntnis entscheidend ist, um sie und ihre Arbeit zu verstehen.

"title : Das slavische Lehngut im Albanischen : Teil 2 - author : Xhelal Yllicategory : anthropologydescription : The present work represents the second part of the study on Slavic fiefdom in Albanian (SB 350) and deals with the Slavic place names of Albania. In the center of this part are the Slavic place names: names of cities, area names and villages names of Albania, which are considered under different aspects. First, the inventory and geographic distribution for each district of Albania are determined, and then the formation types, the onymic contents, and the oldest place names are represented in their respective geographical distribution. On the basis of this work, the already published volume on the loanwords and the planned volume on the waters and field names of Albania, a reconstruction of the historical relations between Albanians and southern slaves is to be facilitated.  Die vorliegende Arbeit stellt den zweiten Teil der Untersuchung über slavisches Lehngut im Albanischen (SB 350) dar und beschäftigt sich mit den slavischen Ortsnamen Albaniens. Im Mittelpunkt dieses Teils stehen die slavischen Ortsnamen: Städtenamen, Gebietsnamen und Dörfernamen Albaniens, die unter verschiedenen Aspekten betrachtet werden. Zunächst wird das Inventar und die geographische Verbreitung für jeden Bezirk Albaniens festgestellt, und dann werden die Bildungstypen, die onymischen Inhalte und die ältesten Ortsnamen in ihrer jeweiligen geographischen Verbreitung dargestellt. Auf der Grundlage dieser Arbeit, des bereits veröffentlichten Bandes über die Lehnwörter und des geplanten Bandes über die Gewässer- und Flurnamen Albaniens soll eine Rekonstruktion der historischen Beziehungen zwischen Albanern und Südslaven erleichtert werden.

"title : El antropólogo inocente: notas desde una choza de barro - author : Nigel Barleycategory : anthropologydescription : El antropólogo inocente es un texto ciertamente insólito del que se dijo: ""Probablemente el libro más divertido que se ha publicado este año"" (David Halloway). El autor, doctorado en antropología por Oxford, se dedicó durante un par de años al estudio de una tribu poco conocida del Camerún, lo que constituyó su primera experiencia en el trabajo de campo (1978), y casi la última. Nigel Barley se instaló en una choza de barro con la intención de investigar las costumbres y creencias del pueblo dowayo. Conocía la teoría del trabajo de campo, pero, como descubrió en seguida, ésta no tomaba en consideración la escurridiza naturaleza de la sociedad dowayo, que se resistía a moldarse a norma alguna. En esta crónica del primer año que pasó en África, Nigel Barley  –tras sobrevivir al aburrimiento, a desastres, enfermedades y hostilidades varias–, nos ofrece una introducción decididamente irreverente a la vida de un antropólogo social.  Después de esta experiencia, el autor se incorporó al Museo Británico, cuyo departamento de publicaciones editó este texto como curiosidad. La excitación que causó entre sus primeros lectores motivó que se publicara después en la colección de bolsillo de Penguin con extraordianrio éxito.  ""Combina el candor y el colorido de los relatos de los primeros exploradores con un agudo ingenio y un desternillante sentido del absurdo"" (Roger Sandall, Encounter).  ""Muy adecuadamente considerado por muchos críticos como el libro más divertido del año"" (Stephen Pile).  ""Pocas veces se habrán visto reunidos, en un libro de antropología un cúmulo tal de situaciones divertidas, referidas con inimitable humor y gracia y una competencia etnográfica tan afinada, como los que Nigel Barley ofrece en esta minuta de su trabajo de campo entr los dowayos"" (Alberto C.)

Velasco Maíllocategory : anthropologydescription : Se trata de una reimpresión reducida del texto del mismo nombre editado por primera vez en 1995. Contiene lecturas de autores clásicos de antropología que abordan conceptos y debates fundamentales, contribuciones de antropólogos a los distintos campos que se reconocen generalmente como propios de la disciplina: el concepto de cultura, la etnografía y el trabajo de campo, el lenguaje, la familia y el parentesco, los modos de subsistencia, las organizaciones políticas, la mitología, el ritual y la religión, la socialización. Se encontrarán en él a algunos de los clásicos, Lévi-Strauss, Hall, Polanyi, pero también a autores llegados más modernamente al debate científico y de los que cabe esperar aún mucho más. El conjunto no sólo recoge temas diversos sino también voces y perspectivas diversas desde las cuales se han abordado tanto la diversidad cultural como las posibles constantes en las sociedades humanas. Este libro es consecuentemente plural. El orden de los temas es el de un manual, pero admite varios itinerarios de lectura según intereses. Aunque de todos modos su intención primera es situar al lector a las puertas de un amplio horizonte de conocimiento y de reflexión: las culturas, las sociedades humanas.

"title : The Impact of Migration on Poland - author : Anne Whitecategory : anthropologydescription : How has the international mobility of Polish citizens intertwined with other influences to shape society, culture, politics and economics in contemporary Poland?  The Impact of Migration on Poland offers a new approach for understanding how migration affects sending countries, and provides a wide-ranging analysis of how Poland has changed, and continues to change, since EU accession in 2004. The authors explore an array of social trends and their causes before using in-depth interview data to illustrate how migration contributes to those causes. They address fundamental questions about whether and how Polish society is becoming more equal and more cosmopolitan, arguing that for particular segments of society migration does make a difference, and can be seen as both leveller and eye-opener. While the book focuses mainly on stayers in Poland, and their multiple contacts with Poles in other countries, Chapter 9 analyses ?Polish society abroad?, a more accurate concept than ?community? in countries like the UK, and Chapter 10 considers impacts of immigration to Poland.  The book is written in a lively and accessible style, and will be important reading for anyone interested in the influence of migration on society, as well as students and scholars researching EU mobility, migration theory and methodology, and issues facing contemporary Europe.

"title : Queer Kinship and Family Change in Taiwan - author : Amy Brainercategory : anthropologydescription : Interweaving the narratives of multiple family members, including parents and siblings of her queer and trans informants, Amy Brainer analyzes the strategies that families use to navigate their internal differences. In Queer Kinship and Family Change in Taiwan, Brainer looks across generational cohorts for clues about how larger social, cultural, and political shifts have materialized in people’s everyday lives. Her findings bring light to new parenting and family discourses and enduring inequalities that shape the experiences of queer and heterosexual kin alike.  Brainer’s research takes her from political marches and support group meetings to family dinner tables in cities and small towns across Taiwan. She speaks with parents and siblings who vary in whether and to what extent they have made peace with having a queer or transgender family member, and queer and trans people who vary in what they hope for and expect from their families of origin. Across these diverse life stories, Brainer uses a feminist materialist framework to illuminate struggles for personal and sexual autonomy in the intimate context of family and home.

"title : Why Men Buy Sex - author : Philip Birchcategory : anthropologydescription : Sex work has been a contentious issue in a variety of ways throughout history – socially, morally, ethically, religiously and politically. Traditionally noted as one of the oldest professions in the world, sex work has commonly been demonised and is often viewed as a social disgrace. While sex work involves both providers of sexual services, most commonly women, and purchasers of sexual services, most commonly men, providers have attracted the most social commentary. Recent research shows that a limited number of studies have been conducted since 1990 concerning men who procure sexual services. This book aims to help reset this balance.  In this book, Philip Birch examines the procurement of female sexual services with a focus on the personal and social aspects of men who procure such exchanges and offers insight into the demographics amongst men who purchase sexual services, alongside an analysis of the reasons why they purchase sex. This book brings together existing literature with analyses of new data to develop a multi-factor model reflecting men’s procurement of sexual services and demonstrates the complexities surrounding the procuration of these sexual services in exchange for money.  The book considers what contribution the understanding of the personal and social aspects of men who procure sexual services has on re-theorising the purchasing of sex in the 21st Century and will be of interest to academics and students involved in the study of criminology, criminal justice, social policy, law, sociology, sexuality and gender studies   Read more Read less"
"title : Chemical Youth - author : Anita Hardoncategory : anthropologydescription : This open access book explores how young people engage with chemical substances in their everyday lives. It builds upon and supplements a large body of literature on young people’s use of drugs and alcohol to highlight the subjectivities and socialities that chemical use enables across diverse socio-cultural settings, illustrating how young people seek to avoid harm, while harnessing the beneficial effects of chemical use. The book is based on multi-sited anthropological research in Southeast Asia, Europe and the US, and presents insights from collaborative and contrasting analysis. Hardon brings new perspectives to debates across drug policy studies, pharmaceutical cultures and regulation, science and technology studies, and youth and precarity in post-industrial societies.

"title : Arcticness - author : Ilan Kelmancategory : anthropologydescription : Climate change and globalisation are opening up the Arctic for exploitation by the world – or so we are told. But what about the views, interests and needs of the peoples who live in the region? This volume explores the opportunities and limitations in engaging with the Arctic under change, and the Arctic peoples experiencing the changes, socially and physically. With essays by both academics and Arctic peoples, integrating multiple perspectives and multiple disciplines, the book covers social, legal, political, geographical, scientific and creative questions related to Arcticness, to address the challenges faced by the Arctic as a region and specifically by local communities. As well as academic essays, the contributions to the book include personal reflections, a graphic essay, and poetry, to ensure wide and varied coverage of the Arctic experience – what the contributions all have in common is the fundamental human perspective. Topics covered in the essays include indigenous identity and livelihoods such as reindeer herding, and adapting to modern identities; a graphic essay on the experience of Arctic indigenous peoples in residential schools; the effects of climate change; energy in the Arctic; and extractive industries and their impacts on local communities. The book includes reflections on the future of Arcticness, engaging with communities to ensure meaningful representation and as a counterpoint to the primacy of environmental, national and global issues.

"title : Girl gangs, biker boys, and real cool cats - author : Iain McIntyrecategory : anthropologydescription : The first comprehensive account of how the rise of postwar youth culture was depicted in mass-market pulp fiction. As the young created new styles in music, fashion, and culture, pulp fiction shadowed their every move, hyping and exploiting their behavior, dress, and language for mass consumption and cheap thrills. With their lurid covers and wild, action-packed plots, these books reveal as much about society's deepest desires and fears as they do about the subcultures themselves. Featuring approximately 400 full-color covers, many of them never before reprinted, along with 70 in-depth author interviews, illustrated biographies, and previously unpublished articles, the book goes behind the scenes to look at the authors and publishers, how they worked, where they drew their inspiration and--often overlooked--the actual words they wrote. It is a must read for anyone interested in pulp fiction, lost literary history, retro and subcultural style, and the history of postwar youth culture.   Read more Read less"
"title : Libertà e compimento - author : Paolo Zinicategory : anthropologydescription : Posta sotto i riflettori dell’intelligenza e della critica, la pratica religiosa deve inesorabilmente manifestarsi come modesto vettore di socializzazione, con vaghe opportunità consolatorie, incline però alle radicalizzazioni del fanatismo superstizioso e del dogmatismo intollerante?    Se la nostra coscienza si lasciasse pazientemente sorprendere dalle congiunture più straordinarie e feriali del vivere – nelle quali l’uomo nasce e muore, genera e lavora, crea e fallisce, ama e soffre – forse scoprirebbe la singolare custodia che la religione offre alla libertà.    Proprio in quelle congiunture la libertà cerca le ragioni della propria speranza e le riceve in dono dai suoi legami: da quelli che l’assicurano al senso della vita a Quello che la rassicura della preziosità di sé, accendendo gli indizi di una sua provenienza e di un suo destino non di questo mondo.

"title : A Glossary of Words and Phrases in the Oral Performing and Dramatic Literatures of the Jin, Yuan, and Ming - author : Dale R. Johnsoncategory : anthropologydescription : For many years, the oral performing and dramatic literatures of China from 1200 to 1600 CE were considered some of the most difficult texts in the Chinese corpus. They included ballad medleys, comic farces, Yuan music dramas, Ming music dramas, and the novel Shuihu zhuan. The Japanese scholars who first dedicated themselves to study these works in the mid-twentieth century were considered daring. As late as 1981, no comprehensive dictionary or glossary for this literature existed in any language, Asian or Western.  A Glossary of Words and Phrases fills this gap for Western readers, allowing even a relative novice who has resonable command of Chinese to read, translate, and appreciate this great body of literature with an ease undreamed of even two decades ago. The Glossary is organized into approximately 8,000 entries based on the reading notes and glosses found in various dictionaries, thesauruses, glossaries, and editions of works from the period. Main entries are listed alphabetically in the pinyin romanization system. In addition to glosses, entries include symbolic annotations, guides to pronunciation, and text citations.

Investigating Culture teaches students to think like anthropologists by encouraging them to compare their own cultural experiences with that of anthropologists who enter a culture specifically to study it.

"title : The rise of the Chinese consumer - author : Jonathan Garnercategory : anthropologydescription : In this book Jonathan Garner and his colleagues at Credit Suisse First Boston, argue that by 2014 the Chinese consumer will likely have displaced the US consumer as the engine of growth in the global economy. Government policy is rebalancing demand within the Chinese economy from investment spending to consumption spending. Strong trend economic growth over the cycle, a rise in the consumption to GDP ratio and steady exchange rate appreciation will likely generate an 18% compound annual growth rate in the US dollar value of Chinese consumption spending over the next ten years and lead to a quadrupling in China's share of global consumption spending.    In order to identify the companies and brands which are best placed to succeed in China's rapidly developing mass consumer market, Garner and his colleagues discuss the results of the first comprehensive survey of consumer attitudes and preferences to have been conducted in China, covering 2,700 persons in eight major Chinese cities. This survey provides valuable data for the business executive or academic seeking detailed local information on sectors including automobiles, beverages, electronic goods, financial services, food producers, food retail, food services, household & personal care, luxury goods, telecommunication equipment, tobacco, and transport and leisure travel.    ""China is likely to be the single most important influence on the fortunes of investors and corporates alike over the next five years, and yet little is known of what motivates and drives the Chinese consumer.

"title : Chronicles from Kashmir - author : Nandita Dineshcategory : anthropologydescription : ""‘What is happening in Kashmir?’  Chronicles from Kashmir explores this question through a site-adaptive 24-hour theatrical performance. Developed between 2013 and 2018 by the Ensemble Kashmir Theatre Akademi and Nandita Dinesh, the play uses a durational, promenade format to immerse its audience within a multitude of perspectives on life in Kashmir. From a wedding celebration that is interrupted by curfew, to schoolboys divided by policing strategies, and soldiers struggling with a toxic mixture of boredom and trauma, Chronicles from Kashmir uses performance, installation and collaborative creation to grapple with Kashmir’s conflicts through the lenses of outsiders, insiders, and everyone in between.  Due to varying degrees of censorship and suppression, the play has not been performed live since 2017. This book is, therefore, an attempt to keep Chronicles from Kashmir alive by including filmed scenes, a script, contextual questions, a glossary, and illuminating introductions by Nandita Dinesh and EKTA founder Bhawani Bashir Yasir. A valuable Open Access resource for practitioners, educators and students of performance and conflict, this book is also stimulating reading for anybody who has asked, ‘What is happening in Kashmir?’  This playscript includes:    Twenty filmed scenes of the play in performance    A range of contextual questions to stimulate discussion on staging site-adaptive theatre in places of conflict    A helpful glossary""   Read more Read less"
"title : Migrant Conversions - author : Erica Vogelcategory : anthropologydescription : ""Peruvian migrant workers began arriving in South Korea in large numbers in the mid-1990s, eventually becoming one of the largest groups of non-Asians in the country. Migrant Conversions shows how despite facing unstable income and legal exclusion, migrants have come to see Korea as an ideal destination, sometimes even as part of their divine destiny. Faced with a forced end to their residence in Korea, Peruvians have developed strategies to transform themselves from economic migrants into heads of successful transnational families, influential church leaders, and cosmopolitan travelers. Set against the backdrop of the 2008 global financial crisis, Migrant Conversions explores the intersections of three types of conversions—monetary, religious, and cosmopolitan—to argue that migrants use conversions to negotiate the meaning of their lives in a constantly changing transnational context. As Peruvians carve out social spaces, they create complex and uneven connections between Peru and Korea that challenge a global hierarchy of nations and migrants. Exploring how migrants, churches, and nations change through processes of conversion reveals how globalization continues to impact people’s lives and ideas about their futures and pasts long after they have stopped moving or after a particular global moment has come to an end.    “A model of what transnational ethnographic research can accomplish.” ELEANA J.

"title : Toms and Dees: Transgender Identity and Female Same-Sex Relationships in Thailand (Southeast Asia: Politics, Meaning, Memory.) - author : Megan J. Sinnottcategory : anthropologydescription : A vibrant, growing, and highly visible set of female identities has emerged in Thailand known as tom and dee. A ""tom"" (from ""tomboy"") refers to a masculine woman who is sexually involved with a feminine partner, or ""dee"" (from ""lady""). The patterning of female same-sex relationships into masculine and feminine pairs, coupled with the use of English derived terms to refer to them, is found throughout East and Southeast Asia.  Have the forces of capitalism facilitated the dissemination of Western-style gay and lesbian identities throughout the developing world as some theories of transnationalism suggest? Is the emergence of toms and dees over the past twenty-five years a sign that this has occurred in Thailand? Megan Sinnott engages these issues by examining the local culture and historical context of female same-sex eroticism and female masculinity in Thailand. Drawing on a broad spectrum of anthropological literature, Sinnott situates Thai tom and dee subculture within the global trend of increasingly hybridized sexual and gender identities.

"title : The Archaeology of Ethnogenesis - author : Barbara L.

Since 1993, Barbara L. Voss has conducted archaeological excavations at the Presidio of San Francisco, founded by Spain during its colonization of California's central coast. Her research at the Presidio forms the basis for this rich study of cultural identity formation, or ethnogenesis, among the diverse peoples who came from widespread colonized populations to serve at the Presidio. Through a close investigation of the landscape, architecture, ceramics, clothing, and other aspects of material culture, she traces shifting contours of race and sexuality in colonial California.

"title : The Spectral Arctic - author : Shane McCorristinecategory : anthropologydescription : Visitors to the Arctic enter places that have been traditionally imagined as otherworldly. This strangeness fascinated audiences in nineteenth-century Britain when the idea of the heroic explorer voyaging through unmapped zones reached its zenith. The Spectral Arctic re-thinks our understanding of Arctic exploration by paying attention to the importance of dreams and ghosts in the quest for the Northwest Passage. The narratives of Arctic exploration that we are all familiar with today are just the tip of the iceberg: they disguise a great mass of mysterious and dimly lit stories beneath the surface. In contrast to oft-told tales of heroism and disaster, this book reveals the hidden stories of dreaming and haunted explorers, of frozen mummies, of rescue balloons, visits to Inuit shamans, and of the entranced female clairvoyants who travelled to the Arctic in search of John Franklin?s lost expedition. Through new readings of archival documents, exploration narratives, and fictional texts, these spectral stories reflect the complex ways that men and women actually thought about the far North in the past. This revisionist historical account allows us to make sense of current cultural and political concerns in the Canadian Arctic about the location of Franklin?s ships.   Read more Read less"

"title : Immigration, 'race' and ethnicity in contemporary France - author : Alec G.

It has stirred up controversies over concepts such as the ghetto' and theunderclass': it has erupted in flashpoints such as the Islamic headscarf affair, the Gulf War and the reform of French nationality laws, and it has become central to the political debate with the rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme right-wing Front National. This is the first comprehensive survey to be published in English covering developments in this field during the last twenty years. Spanning politics and economics, social structures and cultural practices, this authoritative study will be of keen interest to undergraduates and researchers in French studies, migration studies and ethnic relations, and a wide range of social science disciplines.

"title : Loving animals - author : Kathy Rudycategory : anthropologydescription : "" The contemporary animal rights movement encompasses a wide range of sometimes-competing agendas from vegetarianism to animal liberation. For people for whom pets are family members--animal lovers outside the fray--extremist positions in which all human-animal interaction is suspect often discourage involvement in the movement to end cruelty to other beings. In Loving Animals, Kathy Rudy argues that in order to achieve such goals as ending animal testing and factory farming, activists need to be better attuned to the profound emotional, even spiritual, attachment that many people have with the animals in their lives.Offering an alternative to both the acceptance of animal exploitation and radical animal liberation, Rudy shows that a deeper understanding of the nature of our feelings for and about animals can redefine the human-animal relationship in a positive way. Through extended interviews with people whose lives are intertwined with animals, analysis of the cultural representation of animals, and engaging personal accounts, she explores five realms in which humans use animals: as pets, for food, in entertainment, in scientific research, and for clothing. In each case she presents new methods of animal advocacy to reach a more balanced and sustainable relationship association built on reciprocity and connection.Using this intense emotional bond as her foundation, Rudy suggests that the nearly universal stories we tell of living with and loving animals will both broaden the support for animal advocacy and inspire the societal changes that will improve the lives of animals--and humans--everywhere.

"title : Given to the Goddess - author : Lucinda Rambergcategory : anthropologydescription : Who and what are marriage and sex for? Whose practices and which ways of talking to god can count as religion? Lucinda Ramberg considers these questions based upon two years of ethnographic research on an ongoing South Indian practice of dedication in which girls, and sometimes boys, are married to a goddess. Called devadasis, or jogatis, those dedicated become female and male women who conduct the rites of the goddess outside the walls of her main temple and transact in sex outside the bounds of conjugal matrimony.  Marriage to the goddess, as well as the rites that the dedication ceremony authorizes jogatis to perform, have long been seen as illegitimate and criminalized. Kinship with the goddess is productive for the families who dedicate their children, Ramberg argues, and yet it cannot conform to modern conceptions of gender, family, or religion. This nonconformity, she suggests, speaks to the limitations of modern categories, as well as to the possibilities of relations—between and among humans and deities—that exceed such categories.

"title : The Behavioral Ecology of the Tibetan Macaque - author : Jin-Hua Licategory : anthropologydescription : This open access book summarizes the multi-disciplinary results of one of China’s main primatological research projects on the endemic Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana), which had continued for over 30 years, but which had never been reported on systematically. Dedicated to this exceptional Old World monkey, this book makes the work of Chinese primatologists on the social behavior, cooperation, culture, cognition, group dynamics, and emerging technologies in primate research accessible to the international scientific community. One of the most impressive Asian monkeys, and the largest member of its genus, the Tibetan macaque deserves to be better known. This volume goes a long way towards bringing this species into the spotlight with many excellent behavioral analyses from the field. - Frans de Waal, Professor of Psychology, Emory University, USA. Macaques matter. To understand primate patterns and trends, and to gain important insight into humanity, we need to augment and expand our engagement with the most successful and widespread primate genus aside from Homo. This volume focuses on the Tibetan macaque, a fascinating species with much to tell us about social behavior, physiology, complexity and the macaque knack for interfacing with humans. This book is doubly important for primatology in that beyond containing core information on this macaque species, it also reflects an effective integrated collaboration between Chinese scholars and a range of international colleagues—exactly the type of collaborative engagement primatology needs. This volume is a critical contribution to a global primatology. - Agustín Fuentes, Professor of Anthropology, University of Notre Dame, USA. I have many fond memories of my association with Mt. Huangshan research beginning in 1983, when together with Professor Qishan Wang we established this site. It is such a beautiful place and I miss it. It is gratifying to see how far research has progressed since we began work there, becoming more internationalized and very much a collaborative endeavor under the long-term direction of Professor Jin-Hua Li and colleagues. This book highlights the increased interest in this species, representing a variety of disciplines ranging from macro aspects of behavior, cognition and sociality, to micro aspects of microbes, parasites and disease, authored by a group of renowned Chinese and international primatologists. I applaud their efforts and expect more interesting work to come from this site in the years ahead. - Kazuo Wada, Professor Emeritus, Kyoto University, Japan.   Read more Read less"
"title : The real planet of the apes - author : David R. Beguncategory : anthropologydescription : Was Darwin wrong when he traced our origins to Africa? The Real Planet of the Apes makes the explosive claim that it was in Europe, not Africa, where apes evolved the most important hallmarks of our human lineage--such as bipedalism, dexterous hands, and larger brains. In this compelling and accessible book, David Begun, one of the world's leading paleoanthropologists, transports readers to an epoch in the remote past when the Earth was home to many migratory populations of ape species. Drawing on the latest astonishing discoveries in the fossil record as well as his own experiences conducting field expeditions across Europe and Asia, Begun provides a sweeping evolutionary history of great apes and humans. He tells the story of how one of the earliest members of our evolutionary group--a new kind of primate called Proconsul--evolved from lemur-like monkeys in the primeval forests of Africa. Begun vividly describes how, over the next 10 million years, these hominoids expanded into Europe and Asia and evolved climbing and hanging adaptations, longer maturation times, and larger brains, setting the stage for the emergence of humans.

"title : Visualising Facebook - author : Daniel Millercategory : anthropologydescription : Since the growth of social media, human communication has become much more visual. This book presents a scholarly analysis of the images people post on a regular basis to Facebook. By including hundreds of examples, readers can see for themselves the differences between postings from a village north of London, and those from a small town in Trinidad. Why do women respond so differently to becoming a mother in England from the way they do in Trinidad? How are values such as carnival and suburbia expressed visually? Based on an examination of over 20,000 images, the authors argue that phenomena such as selfies and memes must be analysed in their local context. The book aims to highlight the importance of visual images today in patrolling and controlling the moral values of populations, and explores the changing role of photography from that of recording and representation, to that of communication, where an image not only documents an experience but also enhances it, making the moment itself more exciting.

"title : La quête anthropologique du droit - author : Christoph Eberhardcategory : anthropologydescription : Le monde change et avec lui nos manières de penser le droit. Comment comprendre les transformations juridiques contemporaines ? Quel sens leur donner à l'âge de la globalisation ? Comment aborder le droit comme un révélateur de nos manières de vivre ensemble autant que comme l'un des outils de leur mise en forme ? Ces questions centrales à la démarche anthropologique d'Etienne Le Roy, l'un des bâtisseurs de l'anthropologie du droit française, sont éclairées dans cet ouvrage à travers des études enracinées sur les cinq continents et privilégiant la dimension anthropologique du droit. Les auteurs abordent les défis qui se présentent à un droit de plus en plus inscrit entre global et local et s'interrogent sur les métamorphoses contemporaines de l'Etat et de la Justice. Loin d'une anthropologie "" exotique "" ce sont les enjeux contemporains des restructurations juridiques, politiques et économiques dans la rencontre des cultures qui sont abordés. Les questionnements théoriques ainsi que les études de terrain inscrites dans les champs de recherche privilégiés de l'anthropologie du droit tels que le foncier et la gestion des ressources naturelles, la médiation et les modes alternatifs de règlement des conflits reflètent les évolutions les plus récentes dans le domaine et offrent un panorama des recherches et enjeux dans le champ de l'anthropologie du droit. Ces analyses qui partagent toutes la vision d'Etienne Le Roy selon lequel "" le droit est moins ce qu'en disent les textes que ce qu'en font les acteurs "" contribuent à mieux comprendre le monde dans lequel nous vivons et à éclairer les questions brûlantes que constituent aujourd'hui la gouvernance et le développement durable dans une mondialisation respectueuse de la diversité des cultures et sensible aux réalités de terrain.

The text addresses the major questions that concern biological anthropologists: What are humans? How are we similar to and different from other animals? Where are our origins? How did we evolve? Are we still evolving? How are we different from one another? What does the future hold for the human species?""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Cartografías de la diáspora: identidades en cuestión - author : Avtar Brahcategory : anthropologydescription : «¿Se ve usted como africana o como india?, me preguntó un norteamericano miembro del jurado. Al principio esta pregunta me pareció absurda. ¿Acaso no veía que era ""ambas"" cosas?». Así comienza este texto, tejido en la intersección de experiencia vivida, debates teóricos, movimientos políticos y las condiciones sociales, políticas y económicas que marcaron la construcción de «lo asiático» como un Otro «postcolonial» en la Gran Bretaña de postguerra.  Avtar Brah analiza así la relacionalidad de múltiples modalidades de poder: clase, género, «raza» y racismo, etnicidad, nacionalismo, generación y sexualidad y propone pensar el «espacio de la diáspora» como un lugar «habitado» no sólo por los sujetos que «se mueven», sino también por aquéllos a los que se construye y representa como «autóctonos». Es aquí donde lo postcolonial se derrama en mil evocaciones prácticas y teóricas para los feminismos y las apuestas políticas que tratan de abordar las complejas realidades metropolitanas de nuestro tiempo.

"title : Futureface - author : Alex Wagnercategory : anthropologydescription : ""An acclaimed journalist travels the globe to solve the mystery of her ancestry, confronting the question at the heart of the American experience of immigration, race, and identity: Who are my people? Alex Wagner has always been fascinated by stories of exile and migration. Her father's ancestors immigrated to the United States from Ireland and Luxembourg. Her mother fled Rangoon in the 1960s, escaping Burma's military dictatorship. In her professional life, Wagner reported from the Arizona-Mexico border, where agents, drones, cameras, and military hardware guarded the line between two nations. She listened to debates about whether the United States should be a melting pot or a salad bowl. She knew that moving from one land to another--and the accompanying recombination of individual and tribal identities--was the story of America. And she was happy that her own mixed-race ancestry and late twentieth-century education had taught her that identity is mutable and meaningless, a thing we make rather than a thing we are. When a cousin's offhand comment threw a mystery into her personal story--introducing the possibility of an exciting new twist in her already complex family history--Wagner was suddenly awakened to her own deep hunger to be something, to belong, to have an identity that mattered, a tribe of her own. Intoxicated by the possibility, she became determined to investigate her genealogy. So she set off on a quest to find the truth about her family history. The journey takes Wagner from Burma to Luxembourg, from ruined colonial capitals with records written on banana leaves to Mormon databases and high-tech genetic labs. As she gets closer to solving the mystery of her own ancestry, she begins to grapple with a deeper question: Does it matter? Is our enduring obsession with blood and land, race and identity, worth all the trouble it's caused us? The answers can be found in this deeply personal account of her search for belonging, a meditation on the things that define us as insiders and outsiders and make us think in terms of ""us"" and ""them."" In this time of conflict over who we are as a country, when so much emphasis is placed on ethnic, religious, and national divisions, Futureface constructs a narrative where we all belong.""--provided by publisher.

"title : Human nature and the evolution of society - author : Stephen K. Sandersoncategory : anthropologydescription : "" If evolution has changed humans physically, has it also affected human behavior? Drawing on evolutionary psychology, sociobiology, and human behavioral ecology, Human Nature and the Evolution of Society explores the evolutionary dynamics underlying social life.  In this introduction to human behavior and the organization of social life, Stephen K. Sanderson discusses traditional subjects like mating behavior, kinship, parenthood, status-seeking, and violence, as well as important topics seldom included in books of this type, especially gender, economies, politics, foodways, race and ethnicity, and the arts. Examples and research on a wide range of human societies, both industrial and nonindustrial, are integrated throughout. With chapter summaries of key points, thoughtful discussion questions, and important terms defined within the text, the result is a broad-ranging and comprehensive consideration of human society, thoroughly grounded in an evolutionary perspective""--   Read more Read less"
"title : Migrating Borders and Moving Times - author : Carolin Leutloff-Granditscategory : anthropologydescription : Migrating Borders and Moving Times analyses migrant border crossings in relation to their everyday experiences of time, and connects these to wider social and political structures. Sometimes border crossing takes no more than a moment; sometimes hours; some crossers find themselves in the limbo of detention; for others, the crossing lasts a lifetime to be interrupted only by death. Borders not only define separate spaces, but different temporalities. This book provides both a single interpretative frame and a novel approach to border crossing: an analysis of the reconfiguration of memory, personal and group time that follows the migrants' renegotiation of cross-border space and recalibrations of temporality.  Using original field data from Israel and northern and south-eastern Europe, the contributors argue that new insights are generated by approaching border crossing as a process with diverse temporalities whose relationship to space has always to be empirically determined.

And man's knowledge of himself in Christ must not be isolated from man's knowledge of himself apart from Christ. An approach to Holy Spirit through human spirit -- of course under the impact of the Spirit of God in Christ -- has never been attempted in detail, with one exception, by Sören Kierkegaard. The present effort in this direction is offered not as anything final and complete but as a theological signpost that shouts ""Stop!"" to a certain trend in the developing doctrine of Holy Spirit and that points in a new direction. - Preface.

"title : Zones Virtopiques - author : Valentin Dandercategory : anthropologydescription : How can Michel Foucault’s notion of heterotopias be transposed into a concept that describes medial and, more specifically, virtual spaces? What could such virtualized heterotopias look like? Can we find traces of utopian thinking within them? ZonesVirtopiques answers these questions in two ways: first by constructing a conceptual framework using notions of utopia and heterotopia, as well as reality and virtuality; and second, by applying theoretical findings to ZoneInterdite, a media art project on military areas authored by Mathias Jud and Christoph Wachter. Therefore, a micro-analysis of medial dispositifs has been developed.  Wie kann Michel Foucaults Konzept der Heterotopien, der Anderen Orte, auf mediale und im Speziellen auf virtuelle Räume übertragen werden und wie könnten virtuelle oder virtualisierte Heterotopien aussehen? In welchem Verhältnis stehen Heterotopien zur Tradition utopischen Denkens? Und lassen sich insbesondere in virtualisierten Heterotopien Restbestände eines utopischen Impulses aufspüren? Diese Fragen nach dem common ground dieser speziellen (Nicht-)Orte (zones hétérotopiques, utopiques et virtuelles) sucht Zones Virtopiques auf zweifache Weise zu beantworten: Unter Bezugnahme auf kultur- und medienwissenschaftliche sowie auf sozial- und raumwissenschaftliche Theorien nähert sich der erste Teil des Buches entlang der Kategorien Realität/Virtualität und Utopie/Heterotopie dem frag-würdigen Gegenstand auf einer konzeptionellen Ebene. Der zweite Teil wendet die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse im Rahmen einer Mikroanalyse medialer Dispositive auf das Medienkunstprojekt Zone*Interdite von Mathias Jud und Christoph Wachter an.

"title : Randzonen des Willens - author : Thorsten Mooscategory : anthropologydescription : Der Band untersucht anthropologische, psychologische, rechtliche und ethische Probleme des Willenskonzepts. Die Medizin führt Menschen in Grenzsituationen, in denen «ihr Wille» in vielerlei Hinsichten problematisch wird: Kinder sollen in die Durchführung medizinischer Maßnahmen einwilligen; Menschen mit Demenz können sich zu Therapien manchmal nicht mehr klar äußern; potentielle Teilnehmende einer klinischen Studie sind durch deren Komplexität überfordert, sollen aber zustimmen. Der Band fokussiert bewusst Randzonen, in denen nicht klar ist, was ein Wille ist und ob eine Willensäußerung vorliegt. An diesen Randbereichen wird besser als in thematischen Kernzonen sichtbar, was Idee und Praxis des Willens leisten und was sie verdecken. Daraus ergeben sich neue Fragen zur Problematik des Entscheidens und der Einwilligung in Grenzsituationen.   Read more Read less"
"title : Anthropocene Unseen - author : Cymene Howecategory : anthropologydescription : ""The idea of the Anthropocene often generates an overwhelming sense of abjection or apathy. It occupies the imagination as a set of circumstances that counterpose individual human actors against ungraspable scales and impossible odds. There is much at stake in how we understand the implications of this planetary imagination, and how to plot paths from this present to other less troubling futures. With Anthropocene Unseen: A Lexicon, the editors aim at a resource helpful for this task: a catalog of ways to pluralize and radicalize our picture of the Anthropocene, to make it speak more effectively to a wider range of contemporary human societies and circumstances. Organized as a lexicon for troubled times, each entry in this book recognizes the gravity of the global forecasts that invest the present with its widespread air of crisis, urgency, and apocalyptic possibility. Each also finds value in smaller scales of analysis, capturing the magnitude of an epoch in the unique resonances afforded by a single word.  The Holocene may have been the age in which we learned our letters, but we are faced now with circumstances that demand more experimental plasticity. Alternative ways of perceiving a moment can bring a halt to habitual action, opening a space for slantwise movements through the shock of the unexpected. Each small essay in this lexicon is meant to do just this, drawing from anthropology, literary studies, artistic practice, and other humanistic endeavors to open up the range of possible action by contributing some other concrete way of seeing the present. Each entry proposes a different way of conceiving this Earth from some grounded place, always in a manner that aims to provoke a different imagination of the Anthropocene as a whole.  The Anthropocene is a world-engulfing concept, drawing every thing and being imaginable into its purview, both in terms of geographic scale and temporal duration. Pronouncing an epoch in our own name may seem the ultimate act of apex species self-aggrandizement, a picture of the world as dominated by ourselves. Can we learn new ways of being in the face of this challenge, approaching the transmogrification of the ecosphere in a spirit of experimentation rather than catastrophic risk and existential dismay? This lexicon is meant as a site to imagine and explore what human beings can do differently with this time, and with its sense of peril.""   Read more Read less"

"title : Learning in contemporary culture - author : Will Curtiscategory : anthropologydescription : This book provides an accessible undergraduate-level introduction to the central educational concepts of learning and culture. In examining these themes it addresses key issues, including: what is meant by 'culture'; characteristics commonly associated with contemporary culture; relationships between culture and learning; changing understandings of how, what, where and when we learn; the relationship between learning, national identity and citizenship; and, the impact of all these on our way of life today. These ideas are approached from historical, philosophical, sociological, political and psychological perspectives: the traditional disciplines of Education Studies. Three further chapters take an interdisciplinary approach, considering the relationship between learning and culture, alternative cultures of learning today, and learning in and for multicultural communities.

"title : Empowering Adolescent Girls in Developing Countries - author : Caroline Harpercategory : anthropologydescription : Adolescence, wherever you live, is a potentially turbulent and challenging time and no less so in the four countries where we undertook our work. Here, transitions    through adolescence are fraught with difficulties, in part due to the deeply    embedded gender norms which determine what a girl can and cannot do and how    she must be. Each specific context came with its own factors: multi-ethnic and    multi-religious communities, remoteness, variable services (if any at all) and, sometimes,    a policy and cultural context without recognition of adolescence, where the    transition to adulthood is short or immediate rather than prolonged.    Nevertheless, what we know from biological sciences is that adolescence is a    developmental period ? a time when the body and mind changes. These changes    bring with them potential which in the right context, can open new opportunities.    Our interest was in exploring that potential and how gendered norms might truncate    opportunities and limit the development of capabilities which every young    adult could aspire to own ? the ability to have a political voice, to be educated,    to be in good health, to have control over one?s body, to be free from violence, to    be able to own property and earn a livelihood, to be economically and politically    empowered.    We were intrigued by the very common experiences of adolescent girls across    multiple contexts. This learning and sharing enabled us to explore in much greater depth what norms are and how they operate within political and institutional    spaces at national and community levels. It also allowed us to explore the changing    and different conceptual understandings of gendered social relations, gender equality    and the usage of the term ?norm? to capture embedded, often implicit, informal    rules by which people abide, and which are bound into the values people and societies    accept implicitly, accept reluctantly or actively contest.

"title : Boots of leather, slippers of gold - author : Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedycategory : anthropologydescription : Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold traces the evolution of the lesbian community in Buffalo, New York from the mid-1930s up to the early 1960s. Drawing upon the oral histories of 45 women, it is the first comprehensive history of a working-class lesbian community. These poignant and complex stories show how black and white working-class lesbians, although living under oppressive circumstances, nevertheless became powerful agents of historical change.  Based on 13 years of research, Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold ranges over such topics as sex, relationships, coming out, butch-fem roles, motherhood, aging, racism, work, oppression and pride. Kennedy and Davis provide a unique insider's perspective on butch-fem culture and argue that the roots of gay and lesbian liberation are found specifically in the determined resistance of working-class lesbians.

"title : The Upper Guinea Coast in Global Perspective - author : Jacqueline Knörrcategory : anthropologydescription : For centuries, Africa?s Upper Guinea Coast region has been the site of regional and global interactions, with societies from different parts of the African continent and beyond engaging in economic trade, cultural exchange, and various forms of conflict. This book provides a wide-ranging look at how such encounters have continued into the present day, identifying the disruptions and continuities in religion, language, economics, and various other social phenomena that have resulted. These accounts show a region that, while still grappling with the legacies of colonialism and the slave trade, is both shaped by and an important actor within ever-denser global networks, exhibiting consistent transformation and creative adaptation.

"title : The economics of health and wellness - author : Donald C. Woodcategory : anthropologydescription : This 26th volume in the Research in Economic Anthropology series differs in two main ways from all those that have come before. For one, it is the first REA volume to focus exclusively on the issue of health. In addition, it is not as concerned overall with economic or social theory, or with economic reasoning and action, as other volumes have been. Rather, it concentrates on the identification and analysis of important economic factors in the production of health and wellness. The volume consists of ten original anthropological papers that explore the general theme of the economics of health and wellness in a variety of ways. Some of these papers are more strongly ethnographic in nature, relying wholly on qualitative data derived from participant-observer methods at which ethnographers excel. Other papers successfully blend such information with quantitative data drawn from surveys, questionnaires, and even from biological samples. All papers, however, are grounded in empirical methods and based on data drawn from the personal investigations of the authors. Subjects and geographic areas represented in the volume are: 1) Lakota residents of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, USA, 2) rural people of Bangladesh, 3) mental health care facilities and systems in Texas, USA, 4) unsuccessful rural-urban migrants in Botswana, Southern Africa, 5) loggers in British Columbia, Canada, 6) municipal bus drivers in San Francisco, California, 7) poor residents of Puebla, Mexico, 8) slum dwellers of Lima, Peru, 9) female victims of domestic abuse in Northern Vietnam, and 10) followers of Tibetan Buddhism in France.

"title : Pambalas - author : Chakrapani Ghantacategory : anthropologydescription : Ghanta Chakrapani’s study, “Pambalas: The Vanishing Dalit Priests” belongs to the new genre of social history. It is truly a history from below and a comprehensive account of non-elites/non-hegemonic classes and communities. It is a part of the recent upsurge in Dalit studies at the regional level. In fact, the writing of social history of Andhra Pradesh from a dalit/subaltern perspective had begun just a decade ago or so. Chakrapani’s work is a clear departure from conventional sociological writing, in the sense that he adopts a Longue Duree approach and a historical perspective in analysing the socio-cultural history of a Dalit community. In writing ethno-history of an important Dalit sub-caste he not only depends on the tools of his own discipline (Sociology) but also makes use of the historical data. Hence, it is a study based on interdisciplinary framework. Moreover, it is a welcome departure from traditional sociological studies which deal with field-based village studies from a short-term, narrow perspective. The merit of this study lies in the fact that it makes Caste System and Dalit identity as the central analytical problematic.   Read more Read less"

"title : Rebel Souls - author : Justin Martincategory : poetrydescription : ""In the shadow of the Civil War, a circle of radicals in a rowdy saloon changed American society and helped set Walt Whitman on the path to poetic immortality. Rebel Souls is the first book ever written about the colorful group of artists-- regulars at Pfaff's Saloon in Manhattan--rightly considered America's original Bohemians. Besides a young Whitman, the circle included actor Edwin Booth; trailblazing stand-up comic Artemus Ward; psychedelic drug pioneer and author Fitz Hugh Ludlow; and brazen performer Adah Menken, famous for her Naked Lady routine. Central to their times, the artists managed to forge connections with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mark Twain, and even Abraham Lincoln. This vibrant tale, packed with original research, offers the pleasures of a great group biography like The Banquet Years or The Metaphysical Club. Justin Martin shows how this first bohemian culture--imported from Paris to a dingy Broadway saloon--seeded and nurtured an American tradition of rebel art that thrives to this day. ""--  ""Certain moments and settings in literary history are so dense and rich as to require a group biography. Bloomsbury, Berlin in the 20's, or the periods in Paris that inspired The Banquet Years or A Charmed Circle are among these.The birth of Bohemia in New York on the eve of the Civil War is such a moment. The brilliant, rowdy circle included Walt Whitman, Edwin Booth, the comic Artemus Ward, and reached out to involve Emerson, Albert Bierstadt, and Mark Twain. Whitman towered over this circle which in turn liberated both his life and his work. In this ebullient story, packed with original research, Justin Martin, the author of 3 acclaimed and successful biographies, shows how this first ""Bohemian"" culture, imported from Paris, sprouted in a dingy Broadway saloon against the shadow of a fractured nation, nurtured and launched Walt Whitman and seeded an American tradition of rebel art that endures today.

"title : Poems at the edge of differences - author : Renate Papkecategory : poetrydescription : This study consists of two parts. The first part offers an overview of feminism’s theory of differences. The second part deals with the textual analysis of poems about ‘mothering’ by women from India, the Caribbean and Africa. Literary criticism has dealt with the representation of ‘mothering’ in prose texts. The exploration of lyrical texts has not yet come. Since the late 1970s, the acknowledgement of and the commitment to difference has been foundational for feminist theory and activism. This investigation promotes a differentiated, ‘locational’ feminism (Friedman). The comprehensive theoretical discussion of feminism’s different concepts of ‘gender’, ‘race’, ‘ethnicity’ and ‘mothering’ builds the foundation for the main part: the presentation and analysis of the poems. The issue of ‘mothering’ foregrounds the communicative aspect of women’s experience and wants to bridge the gap between theory and practice. This study, however, does not intend to specify ‘mothering’ as a universal and unique feminine characteristic. It underlines a metaphorical use and discusses the concepts of ‘nurturing’, ‘maternal practice’ and ‘social parenthood’. Regarding the extensive material, this study understands itself as an explorative not concluding investigation placed at the intersections of gender studies, postcolonial and classical literary studies. Most of all, it aims at initiating a dialogue and interchange between scholars and students in the Western and the ‘Third World’.   Read more Read less"

"title : Beliefs and blasphemies: a collection of poems - author : Virginia Hamilton Adaircategory : poetrydescription : Beliefs and Blasphemies exhibits the same qualities--accessibility, deep feeling, wisdom, humor, and technical brilliance--that made Virginia Hamilton Adair's first collection of poems, Ants on the Melon, into a bestseller and a literary landmark. Here Mrs. Adair devotes her attention to a single theme, religion, but in her brilliant performance the theme's variations turn out to be wide and deep--from reverence to iconoclasm, from comedy to profundity, from joy to lament. If you are looking for Hallmark platitudes or E-Z faith, look elsewhere.In ""Saving the Songs,"" for example, we reconsider Martin Luther's penchant for recycling barroom tunes into hymns: ""Said Luther of the singing in saloons,/'Why should the devil have the choicest tunes?'"" More soberly, in ""The Reassem-blage,"" we are asked to test the extremes of the Christian version of the hereafter--""one a verdict brutal beyond imagination,/the other by most reports an eternity of boredom""--against our hearts' hopes. The conclusion? ""Some myths are too terrible for our believing."" ""Goddesses First"" muses about the primacy of female deities in many religious myths. ""Choosing"" uses the poet's virtual blindness to explain her celebration of the only distinction her ""frail vision can discern"": the literal difference between night and day. Zen temples and the chapel at a state mental hospital, animism and meditation, whores and angels--this curious, witty, and compassionate sensibility encompasses them all.Virginia Hamilton Adair is a uniquely American poet--restless in her lyrical investigations, hopeful and honest, rigorous in her formal accomplishments, spontaneous in her emotions. Beliefs and Blasphemies will appeal to anyone who has ever thought about first things or final things--anyone who enjoys speculating about how we got here and where we're going--and it will reconfirm its author's stature as a national treasure.From the Hardcover edition.

"title : Practical gods - author : Carl Denniscategory : poetrydescription : Practical Gods is the eighth collection by Carl Dennis, a critically acclaimed poet and recent winner of one of the most prestigious poetry awards, the Ruth Lilly Prize. Carl Dennis has won acclaim for ""wise, original, and often deeply moving"" poems that ""ease the reader out of accustomed modes of seeing and perceiving"" (The New York Times). Many of the poems in this new book involve an attempt to enter into dialogue with pagan and biblical perspectives, to throw light on ordinary experience through metaphor borrowed from religious myth and to translate religious myth into secular terms. While making no claims to put us in touch with some ultimate reality, these clear, precise, sensitive poems help us to pay homage to the everyday household gods that are easy to ignore, the gods that sustain life and make it rewarding.

"title : Blowout - author : Denise Duhamelcategory : poetrydescription : ""In Blowout, Denise Duhamel asks the same question that Frankie Lyman & the Teenagers asked back in 1954--'Why Do Fools Fall in Love?' Duhamel's poems readily admit that she is a love-struck fool, but also embrace the 'crazy wisdom' of the Fool of the Tarot deck and the fool as entertainer or jester. From a kindergarten crush to a failed marriage and beyond, Duhamel explores the nature of romantic love and her own limitations. She also examines love through music, film, and history--Michelle and Barak Obama's inauguration and Cleopatra's ancient sex toy. Duhamel chronicles the perilous cruelties of love gone awry, but also reminds us of the compassion and transcendence in the aftermath. In 'Having a Diet Coke with You,' she asserts that 'love poems are the most difficult poems to write / because each poem contains its opposite its loss / and that no matter how fierce the love of a couple / one of them will leave the other / if not through betrayal / then through death.' Yet, in Blowout, Duhamel fiercely and foolishly embraces the poetry of love.""--from publisher's description   Read more Read less"
"title : Morning, Paramin - author : Derek Walcottcategory : poetrydescription : Morning , Paramin offers us a stunning collaboration between a Nobel Prize-winning poet, Derek Walcott, and a renowned figurative painter, Peter Doig. It journeys through the physical and psychological landscapes of two lives, from the snowy landscapes of Edmonton to the sun-washed shores of the Caribbean, from the process of mourning a loved one to the experience of watching a film. Taking the form of a call-and-response, with paintings on one side and poetry on the other, Morning Paramin lets Walcott's characteristic perception and wit shine through in his illuminating responses to Doig's luminescent paintings. Both poems and paintings are triumphant celebrations of life's pleasures and pains--loving, observing, aging. Walcott, born and living in St. Lucia, and Doig, living in Trinidad, engage in a powerful dialogue on the Caribbean's colonial legacy, the politics of home and belonging, and the boundaries of art. A poignant exploration of a friendship and a vibrant meditation on the difficult beauty of the Caribbean, Morning , Paramin probes the boundaries of communication and celebrates the thrills of a shared language.

"title : Sonata Mulattica - author : Rita Dovecategory : poetrydescription : Detailing the volatile relationship between the black violinist George Bridgetower and Beethoven, this is a ""masterful collection"" (Los Angeles Times).  The son of a white woman and an “African Prince,” George Polgreen Bridgetower (1780–1860) travels to Vienna to meet “bad-boy” genius Ludwig van Beethoven. The great composer’s subsequent sonata is originally dedicated to the young mulatto, but George, exuberant with acclaim, offends Beethoven over a woman. From this crucial encounter evolves a grandiose yet melancholy poetic tale. (W. W. Norton)   Read more Read less"
"title : Injury time - author : Clive Jamescategory : poetrydescription : The publication of Clive James's Sentenced to Life was a major literary event. Facing the end, James looked back over his life with a clear-eyed and unflinching honesty to produce his finest work: poems of extraordinary power that spoke to our most elemental emotions. Injury Time finds James with more time on the clock than he had anticipated, and all the more determined to use it wisely - to capture the treasurable moment, and think about how best to live his remaining days while the sense of his own impending absence grows all the more powerfully acute. In a series of intimate poems - from childhood memories of his mother, to a vision of his granddaughter in graceful acrobatic flight - James declares 'family' to be our greatest blessing. He also writes beautifully of the Australia where he began his life, and where he hopes to 'reach the end'. Throughout Injury Time, James weaves poems which reflect on the consolation and wisdom to be found in the art, music and books which have become ever more precious to him in his last years. The poems in this moving, inspirational and unsentimental book are as accomplished as any he has ever written; indeed the unexpected gift of James's Injury Time shows him to be in the form of his life.

"title : The broken word - author : Adam Fouldscategory : poetrydescription : A narrative sequence of extraordinary power - the first book of poetry from a major new writer.Set in the 1950s, The Broken Word is an extraordinary poetic sequence that animates and illuminates a dark, terrifying period in British colonial history.The combination here of language and imagery that feel utterly contemporary, and subject matter – tribal violence and subsequent retribution – that seems almost Homeric, gives the narrative all the febrile energy of classical drama, re-charged and re-imagined. Tom has returned to his family's farm in Kenya for the summer vacation between school and university when he is swept up by the events of the Mau Mau uprising. Beginning with sporadic, brutal attacks by dispossessed Kikuyu on the British now occupying their land – attacks often executed with nothing more than traditional panga knives – the conflict escalates as the terrified British stop at nothing to re-impose order, eventually driving most of the Kikuyu population into the prison camps of what has become known as 'Britain's Gulag'. As Tom is propelled into violence and horror the poem mutates into a meditation on the inheritance of conflict, the destruction of innocence and the impossibility of afterwards saying what one has seen.Written with rigour, intelligence, and a fierce, unsparing clarity, this is profound, lyrical work with that rare confidence and thrilling originality that announce the arrival of a significant new voice.

"title : Inri - author : Raúl Zuritacategory : poetrydescription : """"INRI"" responds to the need to find a language for an event that was kept hidden and excluded from official records in Chile: the fact that the bodies of the disappeared were thrown out of helicopters into the mouths of volcanoes and into the sea. In order to bring this event, which was neither seen nor heard, into language, Zurita invents a form and language capable of bringing it into the present. The one place where these unspeakable acts might be registered is in the landscape of Chile: the mountains, desert, and sea. There the event might begin to be touched, heard, and finally seen. When there are no places from which to speak, 'the stones cry out'. ""INRI"" is written as poetry without regular lines or metre. In the tradition of Whitman or Ginsberg's Howl, it works with long breaths and large blocks of meaning: intensities that overrun the usual measures of speech and syntax. To read it is to experience a strange force pulsing through the language, breaking apart its usual channels, and opening unseen and unheard zones."" ""Zurita, winner of the Chilean National Poetry Prize, is one of the best known poets of Latin America. His work is part of a revolution in poetic language that began in the 1970s and sought to find new forms of expression, radically different from those of Pablo Neruda. The challenge was to confront the contemporary epoch, with its particular forms of violence, including violence done to language. ""INRI"" is distinctive in that it does not speak out of individual sorrow, though this is not missing from the text, but seeks, rather, a new space, out of which love might be asserted as prime human reality, a space which might give birth to a different type of society.""--BOOK JACKET.

Challenging, intense, and difficult to translate, Vallejo's work has often been overshadowed by his fervent endorsement of communism. Noted scholar Ilan Stavans tackles the avant-garde poet's politics head-on in an enlightening new introduction that places Vallejo in his proper literary context, while Margaret Sayers Peden's new translation does full justice to Vallejo's complex literary style. Including Spanish and English versions of more than eighty poems that span the arc of his career, this volume is certain to become the leading collection of Vallejo's work for years to come.

"title : Lifting Belly - author : Gertrude Steincategory : poetrydescription : Often considered the central erotic work of Stein's middle period, this love poem written to her longtime companion, Alice B. Toklas, reveals a vulnerability and tenderness unexpected of one so famous for caustic wit. Associative in structure, the work consists of alternately cryptic and conversational fragments detailing a shared domestic life. A very brief initial section observes the hardships of gay estrangement from society, while the body of the work applauds the decision to endure these for love's sake. Readers will welcome an unusual view of Stein in this first trade edition of a signal work in which ""lifting belly""--signifying sexual union--comes to imply passionate commitment to another and acceptance of oneself.

"title : Lepanto - author : Gilbert Keith Chestertoncategory : poetrydescription : Hilaire Belloc called ""Lepanto"" Chesterton's greatest poem and the greatest poem of his generation. But not only have English classes neglected this masterpiece of rhyme and meter, History classes have neglected the story of the pivotal battle upon which the poem is based.  This book brings together the poem, the historical background of the famous battle, a riveting account of the battle itself, and a discussion of its historical consequences. The poem is fully annotated, and is supplemented with two interesting essays by Chesterton himself. Well-known Chesterton expert, Dale Ahlquist, has gathered together all the insightful commentaries and explanatory notes. Here is the story behind the modern conflict between Christianity and Islam, between Protestant and Catholic Europe, and the origin of the Feast of the Holy Rosary. A fascinating blend of literature, history, religion and romance!   Read more Read less"

"title : The Way Out: Poems - author : Lisa Sewellcategory : poetrydescription : “In her collection, The Way Out, Lisa Sewell grapples with metaphorical and literal hungers with a magnetic density. Frank Bidart writes that Sewell offers a ‘terrible purity’ fashioned out of the ‘desolation’ her poems work through, poems with ‘great weight and power.’ I concur. We encounter an intelligent, elegant, darkly honest poet who feeds our eyes, ears, mind, and heart.”    —Colorado Review  “Sewell searches for what lies beneath her own humanity: her capacity for violence and love; what one’s ‘nature’ determines about oneself; and how the mind and spirit can exist willingly with the ‘knowledge that we are hopelessly enclosed / by the measure of our skins.’ . . . Sewell’s debut collection The Way Out, is a very fine read.” —Quarterly West  “There’s a terrible purity to the desolation from which many of these poems emerge. They emerge with unlacquered finality. Their gaze is pitiless. Cumulatively, Sewell’s poems possess great weight and power. In this ferocious book you will find the consolation of something seen deeply, the consolations of art.” —Frank Bidart  “Lisa Sewell’s poetry brings to mind Keats’ phrase, ‘thinking through the heart.’ More than any young poet writing today, her work frames an urgency shot through with history as she builds a model of consciousness, original, strange. These poems enact a lyric muscle that explodes narrative, throws it wonderfully off track into new regions of feeling, thought, experience.”    —Deborah Digges  “‘We are hopelessly enclosed by the measure of our skins,’ Lisa Sewell writes. The argument at the heart of this book is whether the body is a source of hopelessness or of hope. ‘I put my faith in the physical,’ Sewell tells us, but she understands how belief necessitates doubt, only exsisting beside it. Focused and accomplished, this fine debut collection is a fierce and engaging quarrel with the fact of flesh.”    —Mark Doty   Read more Read less"
"title : Directed by desire - author : June Jordancategory : poetrydescription : Directed by Desire is the definitive overview of June Jordan’s poetry. Collecting the finest work from Jordan’s ten volumes, as well as dozens of “last poems” that were never published in Jordan’s lifetime, these more than six hundred pages overflow with intimate lyricism, elegance, fury, meditative solos, and dazzling vernacular riffs.  As Adrienne Rich writes in her introduction, June Jordan “wanted her readers, listeners, students, to feel their own latent power—of the word, the deed, of their own beauty and intrinsic value.”  From “These Poems”:  *These poems    they are things that I do    in the dark    reaching for you    whoever you are    and    are you ready?*   Read more Read less"

Goodman’s language has a stark candor that is captivating as her lines move cleanly though ruggedly through their transitions.” —John Gery, Swallow’s Tale  “I value its special watchfulness— over landscapes, love, houses, change—and its singular sense of fellowship.” —Pamela Hadas   Read more Read less"

Methods and language archaic and contemporary, botanical and anatomical, inflorescent, cotyledonal—with hair and members. Lady bugs for consolation. A brave new unmalicious mind.” —C. D. Wright  “Liz Waldner is a poet of high wit, high intelligence, and great musical rigor—she may be our Postmodern Metaphysical poet plummeting deeper and deeper with each book into the questions of self, sexuality, and knowing. These poems are so intoxicated with their making that one gets the sense of the sheer pleasure of composition—‘there is no greater pleasure than pleasure in writing.’ And reading.” —Gillian Conoley   Read more Read less"
"title : Tamsen Donner: A Woman's Journey - author : Ruth Whitmancategory : poetrydescription : “Ruth Whitman has recreated the journal that Tamsen Donner lost on her nightmarish journey to California in 1846. With a grant from the National Endowment, Whitman traveled along the route of the Donner party, keeping her own diary and watching the American landscape unfold as it did to the eyes of a ninteenth-century New Englander. The journal, transforming historical fact into poetic insight, is a testimony to the optimism, dogged survival, integrity and courage of a woman pioneer.” —Janet Falon, The Boston Globe  “A work of beauty and force…a major achievement.” —Booklist  “Ruth Whitman is a poet whose language takes on the harsh beauty of the land Donner crosses towards California in 1846…This is Tamsen’s journey, the journey that now draws us to Whitman’s luminous retelling.” —The Boston Globe   Read more Read less"

Forget Language poetry. Forget desires for a totalizing poetics. Fuhrman is a leader in the particular, in ‘infra-surrealism.’ She taboos nothing; no form impedes her complete wit. This full poetry is not only ‘feminine, marvelous, and tough,’ but subtle, searching, and wounded—sexual, social, and smart. Fuhrman celebrates new truth-telling, an art of the spectacular pageant.”    —David Shapiro  “Joanna Fuhrman is a witty visionary for our virtual age. Her poems invite you not just to read but to become immersed in their delightfully protean postmodern landscapes. The work is both exotic and mundane, retro and futuristic at the same time. Pulsating with surround-sound and a panoply of ‘neon fluid’ special effects, this book startles as it entertains.”    —Elaine Equi   Read more Read less"

Jane Springer is on a thin reed in the present moment reciting incantatory poems. May I plainly say, ‘What a goddamn beautiful book this is.'”    —Jane Miller  “I have a feeling Jane Springer met the devil at the crossroads.  There’s not a note she can’t pluck, and the music is like no one else’s: rich as the red clay of Georgia, startling as a raccoon’s bite, ‘crazy as a shithouse rat’ and cool as sweet tea on a sultry afternoon. There’s some nittygritty here, hauled up from the freezer chest on the porch, unearthed like a mastodon that’s been buried far longer than we can imagine. And there is tremendous vitality and sublimity in this ‘dark county of the heart’ where her music comes from. Whatever devilish bargain has been struck, it has been a boon to all parties. Hallelujah for us all.”    —D.A. Powell  “Jane Springer’s poems are dazzling, devastating and utterly original—sound-rich, sensual, sensational—you will be carried away.”    —Naomi Shihab Nye  “. . .a fine spin of thought. . . . a strong pick for American literary poetry collections.”    —Midwest Book Review  “. . .masterful in its depiction of the sensuality and brutality of the American South. . . . These are poems that face the darkness that abounds in everyday life, they express a love of the colloquial, and they give us glimpses of humor and irony.”    —Tuesday Poem  “[Murder Ballad] is a tangled ode to the South, filled with coon stew, frog guts, pig shit, the violence of rape, slavery, and regret. Springer wrote it with the deep, sisterly love of a drunken, wayward brother she knows better than anyone.”    —Ploughshares  “Traversing the despair of the rural south, Springer exploits the urgency and dread of every keening murder ballad, showing how that cleaving is both our undoing and our salvation.”    —Rain Taxi  “Springer shows time and again that this music is an inheritance, the murder ballad that dwells in ‘the dark county of the heart,’ and her poems hold the tension of wanting ‘to erase the ancient, violent beauty / in the devil of not loving what we love.'”    —Phantom Limb   Read more Read less"

"title : Collected poems - author : Marie Ponsotcategory : poetrydescription : ""At last, the stunning life work of this beloved, prize-winning poet will be gathered in one volume, covering sixty years of poetry, from 1956 to 2016. Born in 1921, Marie Ponsot began her career in 1956 with True Minds, one of the famous Pocket Poets pamphlets published by City Lights. After this auspicious beginning, Ponsot went on to an unconventional career, and would not publish again until 1981, when Admit Impediment was published by Knopf. Her reemergence--after raising seven children, and always writing, if not actively publishing--brought us a writer of mature wit, unusual rhythms and a poetry of sparkling surface, though her ear is tuned always to the deeper music of human feeling. Ponsot values the local and personal as a proving ground for the grand mysteries, and in examining the powerful underground life of women, her poetry is as practical as it is profound""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Riding Westward - author : Carl Phillipscategory : poetrydescription : What happens when the world as we've known it becomes divided, when the mind becomes less able—or less willing—to distinguish reality from what is desired? In Riding Westward, Carl Phillips wields his celebrated gifts for syntax and imagery that are unmistakably his own—speculative, athletic, immediate—as he confronts moral crisis. What is the difference, he asks, between good and evil, cruelty and instruction, risk and trust? Against the backdrop of the natural world, Phillips pitches the restlessness of what it means to be human, as he at once deepens and extends a meditation on that space where the forces of will and imagination collide with sexual and moral conduct.

"title : New essays on John Clare - author : Simon Kövesicategory : poetrydescription : ""John Clare (1793-1864) has long been recognised as one of England's foremost poets of nature, landscape and rural life. Scholars and general readers alike regard his tremendous creative output as a testament to a probing and powerful intellect. Clare was that rare amalgam -- a poet who wrote from a working-class, impoverished background, who was steeped in folk and ballad culture, and who yet, against all social expectations and prejudices, read and wrote himself into a grand literary tradition. All the while he maintained a determined sense of his own commitments to the poor, to natural history, and to the local. Through the diverse approaches of ten proven literary scholars, this collection brings out the ways in which Clare's many angles of critical vision illuminate current understandings of environmental ethics, aesthetics, Romantic and Victorian literary history, and the nature of work""--  ""In his biography of Charles Dickens, John Forster quotes from a now lost letter which contains Dickens' only known reference to John Clare. It is not the kind of response we might have expected from a novelist so well- regarded for sympathetic, nuanced portrayals of the effects and dimensions of poverty. Forster defends his subject: A dislike of display was rooted in [Dickens] ... His aversion to every form of what is called patronage of literature was part of the same feeling ... These views about patronage did not make him more indulgent to the clamour which with which it is so often invoked for the ridiculously small. 'You read that life of Clare?' he wrote (15th of August 1865). 'Did you ever see such preposterous exaggeration of small claims? And isn't it expressive, the perpetual prating of him in the book as the Poet? So another Incompetent used to write to the Literary Fund when I was on the committee: ""This leaves the poet at his divine mission in a corner of a single room. The Poet's father is wiping his spectacles. The Poet's mother is weaving."" - Yah!'

"title : Sent by Earth: A Message from the Grandmother Spirit After the Bombing of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon - author : Alice Walkercategory : poetrydescription : Alice Walker writes:""Where do we start? How do we reclaim a proper relationship to the world?It is said that in the Babemba tribe of South Africa, when a person acts irresponsibly or unjustly, he is placed in the center of the village, alone and unfettered. All work ceases, and every man, woman and child in the village gathers in a large circle around the accused individual. Then each person in the tribe speaks to the accused, one at a time, about all the good things the person in the center of the circle has done in his lifetime. Every incident, every experience that can be recalled with any detail and accuracy is recounted. All his positive attributes, good deeds, strengths and kindnesses are recited carefully and at length.The tribal ceremony often lasts several days. At the end, the tribal circle is broken, a joyous celebration takes place, and the person is symbolically and literally welcomed back into the tribe. This will not be the fate of Osama bin Laden, accused of masterminding the attack on North America. In a war on Afghanistan, he will either be left alive, while thousands of impoverished, frightened people, most of them women and children and the elderly, are bombed into oblivion around him, or he will be killed in a bombing attack for which he seems, in his spirit—from what I have gleaned from news sources—quite prepared. In his mind, he is fighting a holy war against the United States. To die in battle against it would be an honor. He has been quoted as saying he would like to make the United States into a shadow of itself as he helped make the Soviet Union, which lost the war in Afghanistan, become a shadow of itself. In fact, he appears to take credit for helping the Soviet Union disintegrate. I personally would like him to understand that the shadow he wishes upon us, of poverty, fear, an almost constant state of terror, is merely the America too many of us already know. It is certainly the shadow my ancestors lived with for several hundred years.But what would happen to his cool armor if he could be reminded of all the good, non-violent things he has done? Further, what would happen to him if he could be brought to understand the preciousness of the lives he has destroyed? This is not as simple a question as it might appear. I firmly believe the only punishment that works is love. Or, as the Buddha said: Hatred will never cease by hatred. By love alone is it healed.""   Read more Read less"
"title : More Imaginative Than Ordinary Speech - author : Cat Ellingtoncategory : poetrydescription : From the author of Reviews by Cat Ellington comes a gracefully adorned compilation of eccentric beauty and elegant prose flowing with milky fluidity and honey-sweet intellectuality.  Presenting More Imaginative Than Ordinary Speech: The Poetry of Cat Ellington, a mystifying collection of poetic productions that glide over multiple genres and wrap themselves around a variety of topics, including racism in America, spiritual warfare, same-sex relationships, delusional disorder, social networking, societal corruption, revenge, oppression, envy, hardship, victory, and much more.  Preceded by eloquent synopses to set the tone, and succeeded by razor-sharp commentaries that will slice through the main arteries of the reader’s psyche, each poem was skillfully authored by the one and only Cat Ellington in her outstanding style of effortless ingenuity, although many in the collection do not suffer the easily offended gladly.  Included in this fascinating compilation are none other than “A Declaration of Independence,” “Enemy-Centered,” “iWonderment,” “The Windows Have Eyes,” “I Call the Wind Mariah Carey,” “And Now A Word From Chicago’s South Side,” “Inspired by Imitation of Life,” “The Golden Goose,” “Mother Chicago,” “This Womanhood,” “Operation imPlantation,” “The Falsifier,” “The Black Girl,” and a great deal more.  Decorated with Watercolors by Ateli, More Imaginative Than Ordinary Speech: The Poetry of Cat Ellington is a deep, powerful, cutthroat, unsparing, and spirited well of truth that will leave a lasting imprint on the reader long after the final page is turned: for the effort is representative of what has come to be expected of its distinctive authorship where it pertains to the written word.

"title : Sinners welcome: poems - author : Mary Karrcategory : poetrydescription : Mary Karr describes herself as a black-belt sinner, and this -- her fourth collection of poems --traces her improbable journey from the inferno of a tormented childhood into a resolutely irreverent Catholicism. Not since Saint Augustine wrote ""Give me chastity, Lord -- but not yet!"" has anyone brought such smart-assed hilarity to a conversion story.Karr's battle is grounded in common loss (a bitter romance, friends' deaths, a teenage son's leaving home) as well as in elegies for a complicated mother. The poems disarm with the arresting humor familiar to readers of her memoirs, The Liars' Club and Cherry. An illuminating cycle of spiritual poems have roots in Karr's eight-month tutelage in Jesuit prayer practice, and as an afterword, her celebrated essay on faith weaves the tale of how the language of poetry, which relieved her suffering so young, eventually became the language of prayer. Those of us who fret that poetry denies consolation will find clear-eyed joy in this collection.   Read more Read less"

"title : The history of forgetting - author : Lawrence Raabcategory : poetrydescription : Lawrence Raab’s richest work to date—his saddest, funniest, most personal, and most searching bookOf Lawrence Raab ’s 1972 debut, Mark Strand wrote:“This is a first book with more authority and wisdom in it than most poets are able to manage in their entire careers. I am amazed by its casualness and clarity, its forcefulness, its engrossing strangeness.” Mystery and strangeness remain at the heart of Raab’s work, but now they are revealed more fully through the world around us—everyday deceptions, inexplicable violence, unexpected tenderness, the comedy of hope and desire. In one poem, Proust appears in Raab’s class to confront a student who disputes the great author’s claim that “the true paradises are the lost paradises.” And in the title poem, set just before the Fall, the snake alone understands how people will come to yearn “for whatever they’d lost, and so to survive/ they’d need to forget.”   Read more Read less"

"title : Boy with thorn - author : Rickey Laurentiiscategory : poetrydescription : In a landscape at once the brutal American South as it is the brutal mind, Boy with Thorn interrogates the genesis of all poetic creation--the imagination itself, questioning what role it plays in both our fascinations with and repulsion from a national history of racial and sexual violence. The personal and political crash into one language here, gothic as it is supple, meditating on visual art and myth, to desire, the practice of lynching and Hurricane Katrina. Always at its center, though, is the poet himself--confessing a double song of pleasure and inevitable pain.   Read more Read less"

"title : Poetry as an occupation and an art in Britain, 1760-1830 - author : Peter T. Murphycategory : poetrydescription : This is a great literary criticism work. It serves as an excellent companion to An Duanaire 1600-1900: Poems of the Dispossessed. It oozes historical significance. Rather than fall into the pitfall of disconnecting a people's literature from their history, the author respects the context of the pieces and of the poets. Story and the oral tradition are well respected in these pages.   Read more Read less"
"title : Brownshirt Princess: A Study of the 'Nazi Conscience' - author : Lionel Gossmancategory : poetrydescription : Princess Marie Adelheid of Lippe-Biesterfeld was a rebellious young writer who became a fervent Nazi. Heinrich Vogeler was a well-regarded artist who was to join the German Communist Party. Ludwig Roselius was a successful businessman who had made a fortune from his invention of decaffeinated coffee. What was it about the revolutionary climate following World War I that induced three such different personalities to collaborate in the production of a slim volume of poetry?entitled Gott in Mir?about the indwelling of the divine within the human? Gossman's study situates the poem in the ideological context that made the collaboration possible: pantheism, Darwinism, disillusionment with traditional liberal values, theosophy and völkisch religions, and Lebensreform. The study outlines the subsequent life of the Princess who, until her death in 1993, continued to support and celebrate the ideals and heroes of National Socialism. Brownshirt Princess provides deep insight into the sources and character of the ""Nazi Conscience"", and is invaluable reading for anybody interested in understanding German society during the inter-war and Nazi periods. The University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Princeton University, has generously contributed towards the publication of this volume.   Read more Read less"

"title : Mínimalâmina - author : Erivelto Busto Garciacategory : poetrydescription : MÍNIMALÂMINA se nos apresenta como um todo: um livro com unidade, inteiro, redondo e que, embora comportando poemas seqüenciais, permite um transitar livre por suas páginas/suportes. Poemas-faturas que mostram grande familiaridade com a intersemiose explícita da poesia da Era Pós-Verso (apesar do verso). O autor, Erivelto Busto Garcia, transita do verbal ao visual em suas várias facetas. A palavra, considerada enquanto entidade sonora, semântica e gráfica/visual (onde comparece com força o elemento cor) faz tudo a caminho do esgotamento de suas possibilidades (e ele é um expert em tipografia - ou melhor seria 'tipomorfia'? - posuindo um ouvido também incomum): paronomásias, anagramas verbo-visuais, sugerindo movimento/animação/ processo/seqüencialidade. Explora, o autor-poeta, o que os grafemas trazem em potencial e demonstra naturalidade no manuseio de tais recursos e assume os resultados como POESIA. Doutro lado, o verbal enquanto sonoridade tem um peso considerável, a começar pelo título (belo) do volume. Dos anos 50, época em que a visualidade foi assumida/defendida como elemento estrutural do poema - e é da Poesia Concreta que estou falando - aos inícios do terceiro milênio dC, o visual se tem defrontado com situações adversas, mas se nos apresenta, agora, como uma possibilidade entre outras, Erivelto Busto Garcia se sente confortavelmente instalado: faz e o faz com a serenidade de quem já se insere numa tradição de rigor gráfico e ousadia. Além disso, sua poesia é daquelas que podem transitar pelos vários meios (media ou mídias, como se diz hoje no Brasil) sem perda da informação estética, da qual é portadora. Pede para estar na REDE, por exemplo. E é por tudo isso que posso dizer da  sua poesia: responde a exigências do hoje. Uma poesia atual, inclusive no lúdico que oferece. MÍNIMALÂMINA acrescenta algo ao corpus da poesia brasileira que, hoje, ainda experimenta. Arrisca (melhor dizendo). Salve! Omar khouri . SP junho 2004   Read more Read less"

"title : Lion Sun - author : Pavel Chichikovcategory : poetrydescription : ""Lion Sun"" contains more than 70 poems by a poet who was received into the Catholic Church in 1988 and who derives much of his inspiration from the natural world. His poetry takes the reader to gardens inhabited by warblers, groundhogs, toads, and bumblebees, to the beginnings of the cosmos, to the Garden of Eden, to the shores of the Sea of Galilee, to the foot of the Cross, and to lonely chapels where God himself hears confessions, where St. Christopher drowsily guards the tabernacle, and where painted statues ""earless listen to the chants."" Pavel meditates on serpents, spiders, thunderstorms, geological processes, and the obstinate sinfulness of humanity. Reminders of the Creator are everywhere:  ""Sight of God, a white-tailed buck / Apparition in the meadow-- / Tines aloft above the rack / A temple's undulant menorah...""  ""Crocodiles are hammered out with tongs / Strong to grapple, strong to sprawl and squat / Fire sprays around them in the forge / Sparks arise, the iron jaws are hot...""  ""A cormorant, glistening with oil and water / A wise crane, ordained as was Melchizidek...""  Pavel's relationship with the spiritual is intimate and affectionate:  ""Our Lord was in the chapel cleaning / Swung his mop in curving lines / As once he wrote archaic dust / So now he soaps a long design...""  ""Mary fell on greyish ice / Near St. Pimen's church on Seleznovskaya-- / An angel helped her, saying: / 'There, there, go slowly dear,' / and led her to Tikhvinskaya...""  ""Gabriel stands behind my chair / Folding brown-blue wings to fit the room...""   Read more Read less"

The discontinuities between bodily experience, the rhetoric of self-empowerment, and institutional notions of visibility drive the urgency behind these examinations. Fractured language emerges from confrontations with intergenerational pain, ethnicity, queerness, disassociation, and unbelonging. 'Greater Grave''s poetic account of a queer (non)corporeality questions the coded, expected narrative of linear, expansive ""growth""--keeping in mind Anna Tsing's writing on Life in Capitalist Ruins: 'Progress is embedded, too, in widely accepted assumptions about what it means to be human . . .

"title : Hold your own - author : Kate Tempestcategory : poetrydescription : ""My heart throws its head against my ribs, / it's denting every bone it's venting something it has known since I arrived and felt it beat.Kate Tempest, winner of the Ted Hughes Award for Brand New Ancients and widely regarded as the UK's leading spoken word poet, has produced a new poem-sequence of electrifying power. Based on the myth of the blind prophet Tiresias, Hold Your Own is a riveting tale of youth and experience, sex and love, wealth and poverty, community and alienation. Walking in the forest one morning, a young man disturbs two copulating snakes-and is punished by the goddess Hera, who turns him into a woman. This is only the beginning of his journey. Weaving elements of classical myth, autobiography and social commentary, Tempest uses the story of the gender-switching, clairvoyant Tiresias to create four sequences of poems, addressing childhood, manhood, womanhood, and late life. The result is a rhythmically hypnotic tour de force-and a hugely ambitious leap forward for one of the most broadly talented and compelling young writers today""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Each Happiness Ringed by Lions: Selected Poems - author : Jane Hirshfieldcategory : poetrydescription : Jane Hirshfield is a visionary American writer whose poems ask nothing less than what it is to be human. Both sensual meditations and passionate investigations, they reveal complex truths in language luminous and precise. Rooted in the living world, her poems celebrate and elucidate a hard-won affirmation of our human fate. Born of a rigorous questioning of heart, spirit and mind, they have become indispensible to many American readers in navigating their own lives. Hers is a poetry of clarity and hybrid vigour, drawing deeply on English and American traditions but also those of world poetry. The poetries of modern and classical Greece, of Horace and Catullus, of classical China and Japan and Eastern Europe all resonate in Jane Hirshfield's structures of thought and in her sensibilities. Indelibly of our time yet seated in the lineage of poetic discovery, these poems are meant to endure.   Read more Read less"

"title : Structure of the world compared to a bubble - author : Anne Waldmancategory : poetrydescription : The Stupa of Borobudur in Java is one of the architectural wonders of the world, designed as both a mandala and as an aid for the Buddhist pilgrim that can be read as a holy book. It has inspired Anne Waldman to create a work which is at once a walking meditation, a ""cultural intervention,"" a ""recovery"" of a sacred site, and a take on contemporary reality and how the busy ""monkey brain"" (as it is called in Buddhism) works and travels. Exploratory and meditative, even playful at times, it expands the sense of invocation and incantation that Waldman is celebrated for, while also reflecting an engaged political/cultural awareness.

"title : Black Moods - author : Frank Marshall Daviscategory : poetrydescription : Black Moods collects for the first time all of Frank Marshall Davis's extant published poems as well as his known previously unpublished work.  Cogently framed by John Edgar Tidwell's insightful introduction, this volume recovers the rich variety of Davis's poetic expression, much of it informed by his political convictions and by his multifaceted work as a journalist. His early work helped promote Chicago as a site of the New Negro Renaissance in the 1930s; late in his career the Black Arts Movement welcomed him as ""the long lost father of modern Black poetry."" Between these two signposts, Davis engaged in a tireless struggle for social, intellectual, political, and aesthetic freedom, lending his considerable energies and intelligence to the fight against racial segregation, anti-Semitism, labor exploitation, and other injustices.  Tidwell examines both Davis's poetry and his politics, presenting a subtle portrait of a complex writer devoted to exposing discriminatory practices and reaffirming the humanity of the common people. From sharp-edged sketches of Southside Chicago's urban landscape to the complicated bright prismatic world that lay beneath Hawaii's placid surface of beach-front hotels, bikinis, and beach bums, Davis's muscular poems blend social, cultural, and political concerns--always shaped by his promise to ""try to be as direct as good blues."" His jazz poetry and love poems offer a lyrical counterpoint to his realistic and satirical verse focusing on urban life, race pride, and fierce social consciousness.  A varied and valuable collection, Black Moods represents the recovery of a powerful and distinctive voice and a marvelous enrichment of African American poetry.   Read more Read less"

"title : Whiskey words & a shovel - author : R. H. Sincategory : poetrydescription : Whiskey, Words, and a Shovel, Vol. 1, is about reclaiming your power on the path to a healthy relationship. It is a testament to choosing to love yourself, even if it means heartbreak. Originally released in 2015, this re-release packs the same punch as the first version, but makes an even greater connection with the soul of the reader. Each piece has been re-seen and revamped to reflect the author's continuing journey with his partner, Samantha King, without whom this book would not exist. Samantha is the muse, the ""she"" the writer speaks of; she is every woman who has felt like she wasn't good enough, and every woman who struggles to find love.   Read more Read less"
"title : Sycamore - author : Kathy Fagancategory : poetrydescription : ""Meditative and richly written, this collection of poems by Kathy Fagan takes the sycamore as its inspiration-and delivers precise, luminous insights on lost love, nature, and the process of recovery. 'It is the season of separation & falling / Away,' Fagan writes. And so--like the abundance of summer diminishing to winter, and like the bark of the sycamore, which sheds to allow the tree's expansion--the speaker of these poems documents a painful loss and tenuous rebirth, which take shape against a forested landscape. Black walnuts fall where no one can eat or smell them. Cottonwood sends out feverish signals of pollen. And everywhere are sycamores, informed by Fagan's scientific and mythological research""--   Read more Read less"

"title : Choruses - author : Quincy Troupecategory : poetrydescription : Quincy Troupe launches a pyrotechnic display of jazz rhythms, political commentary, sports tributes, travelogues, and architectural abstracts in his latest volume of poetry, withChoruses. Merging traditional poetic form with contemporary content, Troupe fashions ""words & sounds that build bridges toward a new tongue"" , as he writes in ""Song,"" an ars poetica. Only Troupe could write a sestina chronicling the mass suicide of Heaven's Gate, or a villanelle for Michael Jordan: ""rising up in time, michael jordan hangs like an ikon, suspended in space / / his eyes two radar screens screwed like nails into the mask of his face."" A masterful technician, Troupe experiments with free verse as well, repeating the same words in three different line-break configurations in ""Images: Three Variations of Shape & Form."" From haiku to tonka, from Mark McGwire to Sammy Sosa, from bebop to hip hop, these choruses ""become sound tracks lifted off a poet's tongue, / / syllables, within moments, are transformed into song...""

"title : Splay Anthem - author : Nathaniel Mackeycategory : poetrydescription : In a stunning new collection of poems of transport and transcendence, African-American poet Nathaniel Mackey's ""asthmatic song of aspiration"" scuttles across cultures and histories―from America to Andalucía, from Ethiopia to Vienna―in a sexy, beautiful adaptive dance.  Part antiphonal rant, part rhythmic whisper, Nathaniel Mackey's new collection of poems, Splay Anthem, takes the reader to uncharted poetic spaces. Divided into three sections―""Braid,"" ""Fray,"" and ""Nub"" (one referent Mackey notes in his stellar Introduction: ""the imperial, flailing republic of Nub the United States has become, the shrunken place the earth has become, planet Nub"")―Splay Anthem weaves together two ongoing serial poems Mackey has been writing for over twenty years, ""Song of the Andoumboulou"" and ""Mu"" (though ""Mu no more itself / than Andoumboulou"").  In the cosmology of the Dogon of West Africa, the Andoumboulou are progenitor spirits, and the song of the Andoumboulou is a song addressed to the spirits, a funeral song, a song of rebirth. ""Mu,"" too, splays with meaning: muni bird, Greek muthos, a Sun Ra tune, a continent once thought to have existed in the Pacific. With the vibrancy of a Mira painting, Mackey's poems trace the lost tribe of ""we"" through waking and dreamtime, through a multitude of geographies, cultures, histories, and musical traditions, as poetry here serves as the intersection of everything, myth's music, spirit lift.

"title : Clamor - author : Elyse Fentoncategory : poetrydescription : Written in part while Fenton's husband was deployed as a medic in Baghdad, Clamor loosely follows the narrative arc of weeks breathlessly suspended between imminences: word or silence, return or tragedy, heartbreak or gratitude. What emerges is both an emotional record and an intellectual mapping of what it means to exist in the margins of a war whose atrocities are filtered home through newscasters and computer screens and the distant voice of the beloved. Yet, these are poems that refuse to be sentimental or didactic. The speaker explores the mundane, the mythic and the prophetic in the same attenuated gaze-- planting pepper starts in the ground, recasting Dante's Beatrice, and listening to the barbed vowels of concertina wire thrum across a long distance line-- in an attempt to speak through the silence that shrouds the very unspeakable. At times quiet, at others cacophonous, these poems marry with lyric ferocity the personal and the political in an examination of language and love in 21st century wartime.   Read more Read less"

In this, his fourth full-length collection, he revs up both music and experience and writes startling poems of emotional intensity that chronicle the restlessness of desire. Sometimes grim, ever buoyant and hopeful, even in the most sorrowful or macabre situations, the poems of Backwards Days are most particularly about the movement of time, physical movement, and the movement of the heart. Through landscapes both real and of the psyche, they live on the edge of an elusive understanding never quite gotten right.   Read more Read less"

"title : Word of Mouth - author : Catherine Bowmancategory : poetrydescription : Starting in 1995, NPR's All Things Considered began presenting poets reading their own works.  Introduced by ""poetry DJ"" Catherine Bowman, these popular short segments allowed listeners to experience poetry as a kind of verbal music, recalling its roots as a spoken art form.  Word of Mouth, edited by Bowman, brings together the poems that have been featured on NPR, providing a window onto the dynamic contemporary poetry scene. A child playing with flashes of sunlight in the aisle of an airplane; a woman describing tropical fruit to someone in a faraway country; a man building a deck with his dead father's hammer; the musings of a Barbie doll participating in a 12-step program: these poems powerfully and lyrically transform the stuff of every day life. A celebration of the poetic voice that includes 33 acclaimed writers, this vibrant anthology proves beyond any doubt that poetry is far more than just words on paper.Quincy Troupe  -  Czeslaw Milosz  - Campbell McGrath  -  C.D.

"title : Between the World and Me - author : JK STALLINGScategory : poetrydescription : Poetry is melodic expression of emotion, and that is exactly what    Between the World and Me (BTWM) offers poetry lovers. Within    these pages, three female poets, Jean Stallings, Diane Martin, and M.    Emily have chosen to express themselves in literally one voice.    BTWM is analogous to a three part symphony. Part I includes And    then She Spoke by new poet, Jean Stallings. Part II Revelations is    written by Diane Martin, and Part III, Perspectives also introduces    new poet M. Emily. Quite without the kind of planning you would    expect, the work of these poets reflects the gamut of emotions one    typically experiences in relationships. The work of Stallings, Martin    and Emily contains an urban inner city flavor from a woman’s    perspective. At times it is quite reminiscent of the rhythms and    poetry of the late 1970s, yet is nevertheless highly contemporary.   Read more Read less"

"title : The myth of water - author : Jeanie Thompsoncategory : poetrydescription : ""The Myth of Water is a cycle of thirty-four poems by award-winning Alabama poet and writer Jeanie Thompson in the voice of world-renowned Alabamian Helen Keller. In their sweep, the poems trace Keller's metamorphosis from a native of a bucolic Alabama town to her emergence as a beloved, international figure who championed the rights of the deaf-blind worldwide. Thompson's artfully concatenated vignettes form a mosaic that maps the insightful mind behind the elegant and enigmatic persona Keller projected. Thompson takes readers on the journey of Keller's life, from some of the thirty-seven countries she visited, including the British Isles, Europe, and Japan to the wellsprings of her emotional awakening and insight. The poems are paired with fascinating biographical anecdotes from Keller's life and samplings from her writing, which infuse the work with richly-rewarding biographical detail. The poems in The Myth of Water reveal the discerning subtlety, resiliency, and complexity of the person Thompson perceives Helen Keller to have been. Through a combination of natural intuition, manual signs, Braille alphabets, and lip reading, Keller came to grasp the revolving tapestry of the seasons and the infinite colors of human relationships. Not a biography or a fictional retelling, The Myth of Water attempts to unlock what moved Keller to her life of service and self-examination. This is a deeply personal story of coming through--not overcoming--a double disability to a fully realized life in which a woman gives her heart to the world.""--  ""A collection of personal poems in the voice of Helen Keller. The poems included in this collection struggle with the humanity behind the name Helen Keller and serve to dramatically portray the person Thompson perceives Helen Keller to be. The poetry takes on many approaches, and as such these poems are based in documented fact filtered through distillations of reading and impressions. Some are fantasies of how Helen might have felt or thought, or how she responded as a woman in a particular circumstance. Thompson hopes, with these poems, to give a sense of Helen's simple humanity and great heart and that they will bring more people to appreciate Helen Keller, a woman who sought justice above all else""--   Read more Read less"

"title : English lyric poetry - author : Jonathan F. S. Postcategory : poetrydescription : English Lyric Poetry is the first comprehensive reassessment of lyric poetry of the early seventeenth century.  The study is directed at both beginning and more advanced students of literature, and responds to more specialised scholarly inquiries pursued of late in relation to specific poets. Jonathan Post seeks to assimilate many of the post-New Critical theoretical concerns with readings of the major and minor, male and female, authors of the period. Donne, Jonson, the Spenserians, Herbert, Milton, Marvell, Vaughan, as well as many non-canonical and women poets, all receive sustained, fresh, detailed analysis.  In widening the scope of critical commentary, this extremely lucid and elegantly written book avoids the limitations of much recent criticism.   Read more Read less"
